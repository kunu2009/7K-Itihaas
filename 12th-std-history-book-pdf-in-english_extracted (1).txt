-   For Teachers   -  The Ancient and Mediaeval History of India was included in the 11th standard syllabus. This  textbook covers a vast spectrum of 500 year’s history of Mediaeval World, Modern India and Modern  World. It will help to create an awareness among students about various historical happenings like  European Renaissance, European Colonialism that spread not only in India but most parts of the world,  the resistance movements against colonialism in different parts of the world, the world after the two  world wars and in the end the transformation happening in present day India.  The   Renaissance   and   development   of   science   in   Europe   gave   rise   to   the   industrial   revolution.  Industrial revolution brought in colonialism. Colonialism in turn, provided impetus to the spread of  industrial revolution. These processes led to imperialism and the spread of colonialism in the world. It  is important for the students to become aware of these interdependent processes.  The   lesson   entitled   as   ‘Colonialism   and   Maharashtra’   emphasises   on   the   historical   events   in  Maharashtra with special reference to European colonialism. In this lesson students will learn about the  opposition to European colonialism that was put up by the rulers and also common people in Maharashtra.  The   rulers   in   Maharashtra   fought   against   all   colonial   European   powers. At   times,   they   were   also  successful in defeating the European powers. This inspiring history is recorded in   documents of that  period written in   Modi   script, as well as documents and Bakhars of later period. A letter or ‘ Adnyapatra ’  of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj written in the context of the British traders is of special significance.  It is a testimony to his farsightedness. It is essential that students should be able to appreciate the vision  of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj. It will develop the analytical ability  of the students to understand the depth of the struggle of people in Maharashtra against colonialism.  The syllabus includes the movements for social and religious reforms.   They are important parts of  the syllabus. It is essential that a brainstorming process be created about the fundamental question that  why a need for social and religious reformation should rise in the society. The students should learn to  ask ‘why?’ while learning history. While teaching this lesson it may be possible to facilitate visits to  historical monuments such as the Residence of Mahatma Jotirao Phule, ‘Prarthana Samaj Mandir’ and  so on. Such visits offer an opportunity to experience history where it actually happened.  The struggle against colonialism continued in India from 1817 to 1947. Indians had to fight against  the French and the Portuguese colonialism till 1960. If possible, authentic historical sources, may be  used while teaching this portion such as the freedom struggle of 1957,   establishment of the Indian  National Congress and the characteristics of the Lokmanya Tilak and Mahatma Gandhi era, armed  resistance by Indian revolutionaries, India’s independence, accession of the princely states, freedom of  the   French   and   Portuguese   colonies,   etc.   Such   sources   include   contemporary   local   and   national  newspapers, documentaries, short films, audio tapes, etc. Thus, the discourse can be made more interesting  and useful.  In the context of World History, the process of decolonisation and the aftermath of the two world  wars that made it possible, secondary sources such as   contemporary films, newspapers, biographies,  autobiographies may also be considered alongwith primary sources such as official documents. This  method will be useful to understand India’s role in the world politics. By explaining the rise, spread  and end of the ‘Cold War’, you will be enabling the students to understand the 21st century in a better  way.  Students are now in a position to actually witness the historical processes that are taking place in  India after globalisation. The lessons entitled, ‘India Transformed   -   Part I and Part II, will help the  students to understand the effects of events happening on the state and national level in the daily life  of people in India.  Based on the content of the textbook various programmes may be planned and implemented, which  would help to understand various aspects of a topic. It may include discussions, group discussions,  projects,   posters, etc. The structure of a textbook is based on the principles of constructivism and  activity based teaching methods. Accordingly, various informative text boxes are included in the textbook.  The information in these text boxes are interesting and thought provoking. There is enough scope for  the student participation. ‘Information, Thoughts and Activities’ is the three-point central theme for every  lesson and also there is scope for self-expression. Supplementary information is provided through QR  Code and links to relevant websites. It is expected that it will be used during teaching and learning  process.

1  1.   Renaissance in Europe and Development of Science  As   the   ‘Mediaeval   Period’ in   Europe  was   nearing   its   end,   it   saw   advances   in  various fields of life.   Europeans discovered  unknown lands and there were movements  of religious reformation.   The foundations  of   the   ‘Modern   Period’ were   laid   in   this  period.   Hence,   this   period   is   called  ‘Renaissance’, which means rebirth.  In this period, the ancient Greek and  Roman   traditions   of   art,   architecture,  philosophy,   etc.   were   revived.   However,  renaissance   is   not   only   the   revival   of  ancient   traditions.   Renaissance   also   saw  overall development in many fields and it  proved to be the beginning of a new era.  1.1 European Crusades and its far-  reaching consequences  Jerusalem and Bethlehem are the two  cities,   which   are   considered   holy   by   the  Jews, Christians and Muslims. These cities  were   under   Islamic   rule   in   the   eleventh  century. Several wars were fought by the  Christians in Europe in the eleventh century  to regain hold on these cities. These wars  are known as ‘Crusades’.  Supporting   the   Crusades   :   The  common   people   in   Europe   were   highly  inspired by the idea of being part of the  wars, which were fought for the cause of  religion. Pope, the highest authority of   the  Catholic Church had announced that those  who fought in a crusade would be forgiven  of their sins and would immediately go to  heaven. This led to spontaneous participation  by common people in the crusades. Besides,  the social, political circumstances in Europe  were   also   among   the   causes   for   the  beginning of these wars.  Roman emperors were trying to bring  the regions of Syria and Asia Minor under  their   rule.   Rich   merchants   in   Venice   and  Genova,   the   two   trading   centres   in   Italy  wanted   to   establish   their   trade   in   the  Central   Asian   market   places.   Thus,   the  crusades were supported by the rulers and  rich traders in their own interest.  The first crusade started in 1096 C.E.,  While giving a call for the second crusade,  Pope   Eugenius   III   sought   help   from   the  French   King   Louis   VII   and   the   German  King Conrad III. Ultimately the   crusaders  were defeated by the Turks. In 1187 C.E.  Saladin, the Sultan of Egypt defeated the  crusaders   by   conquering   Jerusalem.  However,   the   crusades   did   not   stop   after  that.   In   the   course   of   time,   totally   nine  crusades   were   launched.   Despite   the  crusades, Jerusalem and the region around  it   remained   under   the   control   of   Islamic  rule.  Causes of the failure of the Crusaders   :  The failure of the Christian Crusaders can  be attributed to the attitude of the Pope and  the   European   rulers,   who   initiated   the  crusades   mainly   for   their   own   vested  interests.   Besides,   the   other   factors   like  common   people   losing   faith,   rift   between  the Pope and the European kings, dispute  between the Pope and the German Emperor,  non   co-operation   by   the   Emperor   of  Byzantium   also   caused   the   failure   of  crusades.  1.1   European   Crusades   and   its   far-  reaching consequences  1.2   Renaissance Period in Europe  1.3   Development of Science  1.4   Scientific   Inventions   in   various  fields  1.5   Geographic   Discoveries   and  Explorers  1.6   Industrial Revolution  1.7   Economic Nationalism

2  Consequences of the Crusades :   Some  historians feel that crusades led to the end  of   feudalism   in   Europe.   People   began   to  lose   faith   in   Pope.   The   contact   with   the  regions in Central Asia led to the increased  trade and the new avenues were opened for  the cities in Italy and Germany. It saw the  rise of a new class of traders.  The   European   warfare   went   through  many changes. European nations acquired  expertise   in   building   forts,   managing   the  forts as military outposts, building bridges  for   moving   the   army   from   one   place   to  another, destruction of the enemy’s routes,  etc. European kings levied new taxes which  were directly added to the royal treasury.  Europeans   were   introduced   to   newer  types   of   plants,   fruits,   perfumes,   different  styles   of   clothing,   sugar,   silk   and   cotton,  textiles, spices, medicinal herbs and so on.  During   the   prolonged   times   of   crusades  Europeans   came   into   contact   with   the  Arabs   and   got   introduced   to   several   new  subjects.   Europeans   adopted   many Arabic  words   used   in   alchemy,   music   and  commerce.  1.2 Renaissance Period in Europe  The European renaissance began in the  14 th   century C.E. and reached its zenith in  the   15 th -16 th   century   C.E.   These   three  centuries   proved   to   be   foundational   stage  of   a   culture   based   on   rationalism   and  science.  This   period   gave   a   new   direction   to  human   intellect,   genius   and   way   of   life.  People got more interested in unfolding the  mysteries   of   the   universe   by   adopting  scientific approach. Many people began to  write poetry, drama and fiction, a field that  had   remained   untouched   so   far.   Novel  experiments were conducted in the field of  science.   In   the   pre-renaissance   times   the  thought about the existence of the universe  revolved around the concept of ‘God’. Now,  humans formed the centre of this thought.  This way of thinking is called ‘Humanism’.  The European rulers of the renaissance  period encouraged adventurous seafarers to  explore   distant   lands.   They   brought   back  information about the plants, fruits, flowers,  trees,   unknown  species   of   animals,  weaponry   etc.,   from  the distant lands they  visited. In 1543 C.E.  Nicolaus   Copernicus  told   the   world   that  the   centre   of   our  planetary   system   is  the ‘Sun’ and not the  ‘Earth’.   In   1609  Galileo   prepared   a  more   sophisticated  telescope,   which  enabled   further  research   in   the   field   of   astronomy.   The  theories   propounded   by   Copernicus   and  Kepler could be supported by the empirical  observations   made   possible   by   Galileo’s  telescope.   This   facilitated   research   in   the  field of physical sciences.  The   inventions   of   gunpowder   and  printing   respectively   brought   about  fundamental changes in the techniques of  warfare   and   dissemination   of   knowledge.  The   first   printing   press   in   Germany   was  started   in   1440   by   Johannes   Gutenberg.  The first printing press in Italy started in  1451. The   invention   of   printing   has   been  an   outstanding   gift   of   the   renaissance  period.   New   avenues   opened   to   extend  varied   information   and   knowledge   to  common   people.   A   number   of   modern  universities came into existence in Europe  in   the   18 th   century.   The   syllabi   in   these  universities   included   subjects   like   :   the  Epics   -   ‘Illiad’ and   ‘Odyssey’ written   by  Homer,   Greek   drama,   speeches   of   great  orators, literature, painting, sculpture, ethics,  Galileo’s Telescope

3  Try to do this.  Collect information about how the  early European universities worked.  Catholic   Church   :   In   the   pre-  renaissance   period   the   ‘Catholic   Church’  not   only   controlled   the   religious   life   of  people   but   also   controlled   the   individual  life   of   people.   It   exploited   of   common  people   by   issuing   mandates   for   payments  of   fees.   It   also   put   restrictions   on   free  thinking   and   its   circulation.   Anyone   who  dared to interpret Bible differently from the  conventional   interpretation   propagated   by  the   Catholic   Church,   was   sentenced   to  death.   The   humanist   philosophy   of   the  renaissance was instrumental in making a  ground   for   resistance   against   the  overpowering Catholic Church.  Modern   Science   :   Scientists   began  their search for reality by strictly using the  scientific   method,   which   emphasises   on  empirical   experience.   This   very   approach  led to the onset of modern age of science.  Learning   mathematics,   science   and   arts  gained   importance   during   renaissance,   for  example the works of Leonardo da Vinci.  Arts :   During renaissance the scientific  approach   influenced   the   field   of   arts   as  well.   In   this   period   alchemy   began   to  separate from its mystical roots and later  transformed into the scientific discipline of  ‘Chemistry’. The advancement of chemistry  expanded the knowledge of the sources of  metals and elements. A significant change  was introduced in the field of paintings. Oil  paints and also boards painted by using oil  paints were made. The scientific method of  observation of nature made it possible to  paint the natural scenes with minute details.  With the same method, detailed diagrams  of the human body and its internal organs  could be drawn. The work of Leonardo da  It so happened...!  Galileo (1564-1642 C.E.) :   Galileo  established   the   rational   method   of  empirical   observation   and   forming   a  theory on the basis of those observations.  Hence, Galileo is known as the ‘Father  of   the   Empirical   Science’.   He   proved  that   the   speed   of   objects   of   different  weight falling down is equal by carrying  out   actual   demonstrations   from   the  heights of the tower of Pisa in Italy.  Thus,   Aristotle’s   view   that   heavy  objects will fall down faster than lighter  objects, was disproved. With Galileo’s  modified   telescope   he   could   trigger   a  revolution.   He   was   successful   in  enhancing   the   power   of   his   telescope  many   times   more   than   the   existing  telescopes. It benefitted the seafarers to  a   great   extent.   It   became   easier   for  them   to   locate   lands   while   sailing   in  the oceans. With his telescope he could  discover   four   major   satellites   of   the  planet Jupiter. Galileo also invalidated  with   evidence, Aristotle’s   opinion   that  the   Moon   is   self-luminous   and   has  smooth surface.   He proved that there  are mountains and valleys on the moon  and the light emitted from it is actually  the reflected rays of the sun. He had  also calculated the time the sun takes  to complete one cycle around itself, as  27 days. It is said that Galileo was the  first   scientist   to   observe   the   spots   on  the sun.  At this point, it may be noted that  Varahmihir, an Indian scholar, is said  to have mentioned the sunspots ( Tamas  Kilakas ) in his treatise ‘Brihatsamhita’,  (circa 6 th   century C.E.).  political   science   and   history,   etc.   As   a  result of this people began to think freely.

4  Vinci and Michelangelo is quite significant  in this regard.  1.3 Development of Science  It   is   said   that   the   European   natural  scientists   of   the   17 th   century   laid   the  foundations   of   modern   science.   The  scientists of the 17 th   century put emphasis  on   the   following   things   :   to   prove   that  scientific principles established by empirical  experiments   remain   true   despite   time   and  space;   to   convert   the   emergent   scientific  rules   into   scientific   formulae;   to   create   a  new   scientific   parlance   and   so   on. These  efforts helped the progress of science.  Institutions   devoted   to   the   cause   of  science   :   In   Europe   some   organisations  were   established   for   research   in   science.  These   organisations   published   scientific  journals,   which   included   research   articles  written by scientists, correspondence between  them, as also clearing doubts and exchanging  thoughts.   Among   them   ‘Academy   of   the  Lynx   Eyed’   or   ‘Lincean   Academy’   in  Rome,   ‘Academy   for   experiment’   in  Florence,   ‘Royal   Society   for   Improving  Natural   Knowledge’   in   London,   ‘French  Academy   of   Sciences’ in   France   were   of  prime importance.  1.4   Scientific   inventions   in   various  fields  Various   instruments   like   compass,  telescope, thermometer and barometer were  invented in this period. Microscopes invented  in   this   period   made   it   easier   to   observe  various   types   of   micro-organisms.   Robert  Boyle, an alchemist is known for discovering  that the absolute pressure and the volume  of a gas are inversely proportional.   This  created interest in further research on gases  like   hydrogen,   nitrogen   and   oxygen.   The  research in physics was more focused on  various   aspects   of   ‘heat’ and   ‘sound’.   In  zoology   a   methodology   known   as  ‘Taxonomy’   was   developed   to   classify  animals. The research by Benjamin Franklin  was   very   important   as   it   threw   light   on  various aspects of lightening and electricity.  He coined many technical terms, which are  used in the electrical science even today.  Textile Industry :   Weaving of woollen  cloth   was   a   very   old   cottage   industry   in  England. In the year 1738 John Kay made  and   patented   ‘flying   shuttle’.   It   increased  the speed of weaving. The next advanced  stage   was   ‘spinning   jenny’,   a   spinning  frame   with   multiple   spindles,   made   by  James   Hargreaves   in   England.   One   could  work eight spindles simultaneously on this  frame and it reduced the amount of labour  and time of production. In the year 1769  Richard Arkwright made a more advanced  spinning   frame,   which   mechanised   the  process of spinning. It could produce yarns  much   faster   with   better   twisting   and  strength. Samuel Crompton invented a more  modified   spinning   machine   in   1779   C.E.,  named   as   ‘spinning   mule’.   With   this  machine   the   speed   of   producing   cloth  increased two hundred times. In 1785 C.E.  Edmund   Cartwright   invented   power   loom.  In the year 1793 a machine called ‘cotton  gin’   was   introduced.   This   machine   was  useful in removing cotton seeds from cotton  fibers with a much greater speed.  Metallurgy :   England had a number  of   iron   mines   but   it   was   necessary   to  advance the technique of smelting in order  to acquire pure iron from it. Gradually the  fuel   for   iron   furnaces   was   replaced   from  wood   to   coal.   It   facilitated   creation   of  furnaces   that   could   attain   much   higher  temperature   resulting   into   increased  production of iron. Later, special machines  were made to keep the furnaces burning at  a   set   temperature   and   to   maintain   its  aeration. In 1865 the process of producing  steel   from   molten   iron   was   invented   and  the   nature   of   iron   industry   underwent  major   transformation.   At   about   the   same

6  time, a method was developed to pour the  molten   metal   into   casts   for   making   iron  bars (for example, rails).  Use of Machines :   Once a machine  proved   effective   for   one   industry,   people  tried to test its usefulness for other industries  too. These attempts resulted into inventions  of newer machines. In 1783 Thomas Bell  made   a   machine   for   cylinder   or   roller  printing on fabric. By 1809 a machine came  in use for sticking together the heels and  soles of a shoe. Tailoring machines were  made. James Watt invented steam engine.  In the beginning, this engine was only used  to transport coal and iron ore out of the  mines.   Later,   steam   powered   machinery  came to be used in textile industry.  In   course   of   time   steam   powered  ploughs, harvesters, grass cutting machines  were made. These machines could complete  agricultural operations in very short time.  In   America   Robert   Fulton,   an   engineer  successfully   sailed   the   steamboat,   which  was   named,   ‘Clermont’. The   first   attempt  of   using   steam   engine   for   road   transport  was done by George Stephenson.   A steam  engine for railway was also produced. This  railway   engine   could   successfully   cut   the  distance between Liverpool to Manchester.  Later   railway   services   were   expanded  through   Europe.   It   shortened   the   time   of  travel within Europe.  1.5   Geographic   Discoveries   and  Explorers  Marco   Polo   :   The   Italian   traveller,  Marco   Polo,   introduced   China   and   other  Asian   countries   to   Europe.   He   stayed   in  China in the royal court of Kubalai Khan.  There   he   studied   Mongolian   and   Chinese  languages.  Ibn Batuta :   Ibn Batuta was a scholar  and famous mediaeval traveller. Ibn Batuta  visited   India,   Maldives,   Sumatra,   China,  Spain, Sardinia, East and West Africa for  various reasons.  Henry the Navigator :   He was the  prince of Portugal in the 15 th   century. He  encouraged people to go on expeditions and  search for lands, which were not known till  then.   These   expeditions   resulted   into   the  discovery of   ‘Madeira’ and ‘Azores’, two  archipelagos   near   Africa.   These   two   are  autonomous   regions   of   Portugal.   The  Portuguese   began   to   transport   African  people to Portugal and sell them as slaves.  African   gold   was   also   brought   back   to  Portugal by these people.  Bartholomew   Dias   :   Dias   began   his  expedition   on   the   orders   of   the   King   of  Portugal, John II. He reached the southern  tip of Africa, which he named as ‘Cape of  Storms,. Later, the name was changed to  ‘Cape   of   Good   Hope’.   He   was   the   first  seafarer   to   circumnavigate   the   African  continent.  Christopher Columbus :   In the year  1453 Istanbul (Constantinople), the capital  city   of   the   Eastern   Roman   (Byzantine)  Empire   was   conquered   by   the   Ottoman  army. Thereafter it became the capital of  the Ottoman Empire.  Now the eastern sea  route was closed for  Europeans.   It   had  become necessary for  them to search for an  alternative   route   to  reach Asia. With the  support   of   the   King  Ferdinand and Queen  Isabel of Spain, Christopher Columbus, an  Italian   explorer   set   sail   in   the   search   of  India.   He   was   certain   that   by   sailing  westwards, he would find India, as the earth  is   round.   Instead   of   reaching   India,   he  reached the islands near America.  Amerigo Vespucci :   Amerigo Vespucci  an   Italian   explorer   is   supposed   to   have  Christopher Columbus

7  who   organised   the   first   expedition,   which  proved   to   be   the   first   attempt   of  circumnavigation of the earth. Unfortunately,  when   it   had   almost   reached   completion,  Magellan was killed in Philippines. However  his   companions   completed   the  circumnavigation.   Charles I, the king of  Spain had planned this expedition.  Samuel   de   Champlain   :   The   French  navigator   and   cartographer   organised  expeditions   to   North   America.   There   he  established French colonies. He established  the city of ‘Quebec’ in Canada.  Abel Janszoon Tasman :   Tasman was  born   in   Holland.   He   contributed   to   the  colonial rush for searching unknown lands  by discovering New Zealand. In 1644 he  surveyed   the   southwest   coasts   of   New  Guinea   islands   and   discovered   the   region  of   Carpentaria   in   Queensland,   a   north-  eastern state in Australia.  Captain James Cook :   Captain James  Cook   of   the   British   Royal   Navy   set   his  foot   in   New   Zealand   and   Australia.   He  surveyed the islands in the Pacific Ocean  and prepared accurate maps. He cut across  60,000 nautical miles during his journey of  three years.  Louis Antony da Bougainvillea :   He  was a French seafarer. He reached Tahiti  after crossing the Pacific Ocean. In 1771  he   wrote   a   book,   ‘Voyages   Around   the  World’,   which   describes   his   journey   to  Tahiti. Using the information in this book,  French   missionaries   reached   Tahiti   in   the  19 th   century.   They   established   a   French  colony   in Tahiti.   One   of   the   islands   and  also a flowering climber ‘Bougainvillea’ is  named after him.  Mungo Park :   Mungo Park, a Scottish  explorer   is   known   for   his   expedition   to  Western   Africa.   In   1795,   he   traced   the  course   of   river   ‘Niger’   as   part   of   his  expedition.  gone on expedition on the orders of King  of Spain in 1497. The land he found was  named as ‘Venezuela’. In his third expedition  by   following   the   river   course,   he   could  discover the delta region of the ‘Amazon’.  It   is   believed   that   America   was   named  after Amerigo.  Vasco da Gama :   In the year 1497,  Vasco   da   Gama,   the   Portuguese   seafarer  set   sail   with   a   fleet   of   4   ships   and   170  sailors in the search  of India. He reached  the eastern coast of  Africa and visited a  few   African   ports  like   Mombasa   and  Malindi. At Malindi  he   met   an   Indian  navigator and under  his   guidance   Vasco  da Gama landed at  the   Indian   port   of  Calicut   (Kozhikode)   in   1498.   He   asked  King   Zamorin   of   Kozhikode   for   trading  permission. After obtaining the permission  he   returned   to   Portugal.   Thereafter   he  visited   India   twice.   He   became   the   first  Viceroy   of   Goa   and   Kochi,   after   the  Portuguese rule was established there. The  trading   between   European   countries   and  India was initiated through his efforts.  You would like to know this :  The number of European colonies in  the   African   continent   increased   because  the continent had rich sources of diamonds,  gold, copper as well as it was rich with  fertile land, timber and forests. Later the  Portuguese began to capture the Africans  and   sell   them   as   slaves.   Cheap   human  labour was the need of Europeans, which  increased the demand for African slaves  and helped to expand the slave trade.

8  England.   At   that   time   England   had  established its colonies in many countries.  So,   England   could   easily   obtain   large  quantities   of   essential   raw   material   at  cheap   rates   from   the   colonies.   England  could   also   export   the   processed   goods   to  the   colonies   and   sell   it   there   with   large  profit margins using their naval facilities.  The   profits   earned   in   the   colonies   made  large   amounts   of   capital   available   to   the  British   merchants.   Availability   of   cheap  labour made it possible for them to maintain  optimum level of costs. These factors giving  boost   to   economy   prepared   favourable  ground for the onset of industrial revolution  in England. Industrial revolution, however,  affected India adversely. It set the decline  of   Indian   cottage   industry.   The   textile  industry   in   India   almost   came   to   a   halt.  The   administrative   policies   of   the   East  India Company were made to benefit the  British than the Indians. Railways made it  possible   to   transport   European   goods   to  rural areas for sell. It turned into monetary  exploitation of the Indians.  Find it out.  Make a list of the European countries  where the Industrial Revolution spread in  its first stage.  1.7 Economic Nationalism  Rise   of   ‘Economic   Nationalism’   was  an   outcome   of   industrial   revolution.  Arresting   the   economic   growth   of   rival  nations   along   with   fervently   pursuing   the  economic   growth   of   one’s   own   nation  became vary important. It became important  to devise ways to put economic restrictions  on   the   rival   country.   Measures   such   as  prohibiting the import-export transactions of  other countries, levying heavy tolls on their  goods, establishing colonies mainly in the  Asian   and African   countries,   if   need   be,  fighting   battles   with   the   natives   of   the  colonies were part of economic nationalism.  Do you know   ?  Alberuni (973-1049 C.E) :   Alberuni  visited   India   accompanying   Sultan  Mahmud of Ghazni. He tried to estimate  the diameter of the earth. His method  of   determining   the   latitudes   and  longitudes   was   accurate.   Considering  his times, this was a very difficult task.  He   prepared   a   map   of   the   earth  indicating its round shape.  1.6 Industrial Revolution  ‘Industrial   Revolution’   indicates   the  transition   from   manual   production   to  mechanised production. In the 18 th   and 19 th  centuries steam powered and water powered  (Hydraulic)   machines   came   into   use   for  industrial production.  Industrial revolution could happen only  in a capitalistic economy. In the capitalistic  economy a new class of capitalists emerged,  who   were   either   owners   of   industrial  establishments (factories) or could provide  capital to such establishments. To produce  commodities of common use with minimum  possible   production   cost,   to   pay   least  possible   wages   in   order   to   maintain  maximum   profit   margins   are,   the  characteristics of capitalistic economy.  Private   ownership   of   the   industrial  establishments,   manufacturer’s   right   to  manufacture   and   to   fix   the   price   of   the  manufactured goods, also to determine the  profit   margins,   as   also   the   right   of   the  consumer to buy goods of his choice, are  inbuilt norms of the capitalist economy.  In England the atmosphere was suitable  for industrial revolution. Large amounts of  iron ore and coal were available. The damp  climate   of   England   was   suitable   for  producing cotton yarn. With these favourable  conditions,   textile   industry   flourished   in

10  Colonialism   is   a   form   of   imperialism.  The act of a developed nation occupying the  land of a less developed, distant nation and  establishing their rule on the occupied country  is   known   as   ‘colonialism’.   Countries   like  England,   France,   Portugal,   Spain,   etc.  gradually occupied the nations in Asia and  Africa   and   established   their   colonies   there.  India   was   one   of   the   colonies   of   England.  One of the main characteristics of colonialism  is   to   transport   the   raw   material   from   the  colonies to   one’s own country and use   the  colonies   as   marketplaces   for   selling   their  final products.  Colonialism, indeed gives rise to political  and   economic   slavery   but   it   also   causes  psychological slavery. The racial attitude of  the   colonialist   countries   and   subsequent  treatment given to the native people creates  sort of inferiority complex among them. They  develop an apologetic outlook for their own  culture   and   history.   They   begin   to   feel  unworthy. It was said that, ‘‘the sun never  sets on the British Empire.” It was the way  to indicate the worldwide spread of British  colonies.   The   British   Empire   encompassed  the continents of Asia, Africa, America and  Australia.  There   was   a   commercial   revolution   in  the 15 th   century Europe. As a result of the  discoveries of new lands by various seafarers,  the   traditional   ways   of   commerce   changed  radically. European traders began to establish  themselves firmly in Asia and Africa.  2.1 Colonialism : Meaning and Nature  Europeans   reached   all   over   the   world  with various intentions such as the urge for  adventures,   to   earn   name,   to   discover  unknown lands, to search for gold mines, etc.  Later, the trade and commerce increased to  a   great   extent   and   the   European   countries  began to compete with each other.  Wherever   the   Europeans   went,   they  established   their   colonies.   There   was   a  competition   to   gain   economic,   social   and  political   supremacy   among   them.   Extreme  nationalism,   feeling   of   racial   superiority,  industrialisation,   aggressive   approach,   etc.  are some of the factors that led to the growth  of colonialism. Europeans went to America,  Australia,   New   Zealand.   They   found   the  climate of these regions favourable for them.  However, it was not easy for them to adapt  to the climate of Asia. Despite the climatic  conditions,   favourable   or   unfavourable,  Europeans displaced the indigenous people in  their own lands. The British, the Dutch, the  Portuguese and the French, all devised several  ways for demoralising the indigenous people.  Europeans   needed   to   capture   newer  marketplaces for selling their surplus goods,  which were increasingly accumulating as the  result   of   mass   production,   caused   by   the  industrial   revolution.   Besides,   they   also  needed additional sources that would provide  ample raw material. In the latter half of the  19 th   century   England   had   built   a   very  flourishing trade as a result of the industrial  revolution. The British with the help of their  naval   forces,   had   established   supremacy   in  Asian and African countries. Earning surplus  profits,   investing   surplus   profits,   increasing  trade with the colonies for good investment,  profit   on   the   investments   –   this   was   an  unending chain. France, Belgium, Italy and  Germany   were   the   countries,   who,   like  England strove to establish colonies.  2.

11  2.2 Colonialism  2.2.1 Causes of the Rise of Colonialism  Industrial   Consequences   :   Colonialism  was   a   result   of   Industrial   Revolution.  Production increased enormously because of  the new machines. However, the rate of local  consumption   was   much   lesser   compared   to  the surplus production. Hence, the immediate  need   of   the   Europeans   was   to   find   new  marketplaces for selling their products. It was  also   necessary   that   those   marketplaces   be  dependable and easy to dominate.  Requirements of Raw Material :   It is  necessary to maintain low costs of production  compared to competing nations in the market.  The desire to create monopoly in the market  and   the   need   to   procure   raw   material   at  cheaper rates were two major factors, which  made it   essential for the European nations  to establish clear supremacy.  Investing Surplus Capital   :   The Industrial  revolution   added   to   the   wealth   of   the  European capitalists, who were already rich.  They started searching for secure markets to  invest their surplus funds. The markets in the  less   developed   countries   were   quite   secure  from this point of view. Thus, the availability  of   surplus   capital   facilitated   the   rise   of  colonialism.  Sources of Minerals :   The countries in  Asia and Africa had rich sources of minerals  like gold, diamonds, silver and coal etc. This  attracted the European merchants to various  regions of Asia and Africa.  Geographic   Importance   :   European  nations   had   realised   that   the   geographic  location of some regions in Asia and Africa  are advantageous for trade. Malta, Gibraltar,  Aden, Singapore, Andaman and Nicobar were  some   such   regions,   where   the   British  established their hold.  Availability   of   Labour   :   European  merchants needed large number of labourers  at a very cheap rate. The colonies fulfilled  this need. Later, it contributed to the boom  in the slave trade.  The   Feeling   of   Racial   Superiority   :  The   European   colonialist   claimed   it   to   be  their   responsibility   to   civilise   the   people   in  Asia and Africa. This assumed role of the  Europeans resulted in the conversion of many  Asian   and   African   people   to   Christianity.  This also helped the growth of colonialism.  2.2.2 Consequences  The   People   in   Asia   and   Africa   were  economically   exploited   by   the   Europeans.  The   people   in   the   colonies   lost   their  independence.   Their   economic   exploitation  pushed them into poverty.  At   the   same   time,   we   may   also   note  some constructive things that happened during  the colonial period. A new awareness emerged  in   the   political,   social,   economic   and  educational   fields.   Common   people   became  conscious   of   democratic   systems   and   its  inherent modern values like liberty, equality  and   fraternity.   They   got   introduced   to  principles   like   administration   based   on   a  fundamental   legal   system,   judicial   system,  availability   of   education   to   all.   People  became   aware   of   the   need   to   shoulder   the  responsibility of solving their problems, which  eventually led to the independence movements  in many colonies.  Try to do this.  Locate   the   following   regions   under  British   domination   on   the   map:   Gibraltar,  Malta   in   the   Mediterranean   sea;   British  Guyana,   British   Honduras,   British   West  Indies,   Bermuda   and   Falkland   islands   in  the Western Hemisphere;   Aden, Sri Lanka,  Myanmar,   Hongkong,   India;   also   the  countries in Africa.  2.3 European Colonialism  2.3.1 America  While studying the history of the colonial  period in America it becomes apparent that  the   stronger   European   countries   dominated  the weaker countries by establishing colonies  there and pushed them into subjection. The  European migrants seized the lands of original

12  inhabitants in America and at times massacred  them. They destroyed the local kingdoms in  Peru   and   Mexico.   The   original   inhabitants  were forced into slavery.  Portugal and Spain were on the forefront  in   the   competition   among   the   European  nations to establish colonies. Portugal brought  Brazil in the American continent under their  rule   and   so   did   Spain   by   taking   hold   of  Mexico.   There they discovered gold mines.  Spanish colonisers brought slaves from Africa  to   cultivate   sugarcane   and   tobacco   in   the  American fields. However, once the Spanish  discovered the mines of gold and silver in  Peru, Mexico and Venezuela, they concentrated  more   on   mining   the   precious   metals   than

13  agriculture. They established control over the  entire coastline of South America. The coastal  region from Florida to California was held  by the Spanish. Here, they engaged the native  Americans and the African slaves in farming.  Farming and mining earned them enormous  wealth.   Spain   appointed   governors   to  administer these regions. The King of Spain  was the supreme authority. An organisation,  called ‘Council of the Indies’ was established  to rule the colonies. This council was also  in charge of the Spanish trade in the colonies.  Essential raw materials were exported out to  Spain   and   the   finished   goods   used   to   be  imported for sale in the local markets of the  colonies. The trade of gold and silver acquired  from these colonies earned huge profits for  the   king.   Witnessing   Spain’s   prosperity  England, Holland and France also began to  establish their colonies in America.  During   the   reign   of   Elizabeth   I,   the  queen of England, explorers were encouraged  to undertake marine expeditions. Establishing  colonies   was   the   prime   intention.   In   1496,  John   Cabot   was   granted   permission   to  establish colonies on the American land. He  established the British as the ruling authority  in North America.   In 1607 the British built  Jamestown, a colony on the banks of river  ‘James’. Later the same colony was renamed  as ‘Virginia’. Afterwards, England established  its   colonies   in   the   coastal   region   of   North  America   stretching   from   New   England   to  Carolina.   Along   with   earning   commercial  benefit,   welfare   of   the   home   country   was  added   to   the   colonial   intentions   during   the  reign of Queen Elizabeth.  To   suit   its   colonial   interests,   England  began to impose restrictions on the colonies.  The   Maritime   Law   was   a   step   in   this  direction.   This   law   authorised   only   British  companies for the sea transport.  The   ‘Stamp   Act’   (1765)   made   it  obligatory   to   purchase   special   stamps   for  important   documents.   British   colonies   in  America like Virginia, Massachusetts put up  resistance   against   the   Stamp Act   and   also  other restrictions imposed on the colonies. On  5 th   March 1770, some people were shot down  by British soldiers, in Boston, a port city in  Massachusetts.  The   British   parliament   had   granted  monopoly to ‘East India Company’ to import  and sell tea to the colonies.   People in the  colonies   had   started   demanding   removal   of  the   restrictions   imposed   on   them   and  autonomy.   When   the   British   government  refused   to   yield   to   these   demands,   the  American colonies declared boycott on British  goods. In 1773, as an act of resistance, the  local residents of Boston dumped the boxes  containing tea in the sea belonging to East  India Company. This event is known as the  ‘Boston   Tea   Party’.   A   federation   of   the  colonies known as the ‘Continental Congress’  was established. In 1774, a meeting of the  congress was called at Philadelphia. In this  meeting   known   as   the   ‘First   Continental  Congress’ a strong opposition was expressed  to the import of British goods. It was also  decided   to   boycott   British   goods.   These  events ultimately gave a momentum to the  American   independence   movement   against  European powers.  Thirteen   colonies   in   America   came  together   and   declared   independence   from  Great Britain. On 4 th   July 1776, in the meeting  known as the ‘Second Continental Congress’,  a   document   known   as   the   ‘Declaration   of  Independence’ was   adopted.   This   document  was drafted by Thomas Jefferson. The crucial  point of the document announced that the 13  American colonies were  independent   sovereign  states. The key point of  this   document   is   the  statement   about   three  basic   human   rights,  namely,   ‘Life,   Liberty  and   Pursuit   of  Happiness’.   It   was  stated that these three  are the natural rights of  all   humans,   which  nobody can be deprived of.  George Washington

14  The   conflict   between   the   colonies   and  the   British   army   continued   for   some   time  resulting into several battles after the colonies  declared   independence.   Finally,   at   Saratoga  the colonies got a decisive victory over the  British army.   This victory proved to be a  turning point for the colonies as the French  agreed to support them in their conflict with  the   British.   Eventually   in   1779,   Spain   also  joined   the   colonies   in   their   struggle   for  independence. On 7 th   October 1780, George  Washington   defeated   the   British   army.   On  19 th   October,   the   British   general   Lord  Cornwallis surrendered and America became  independent.   The   American   revolt   for  independence, is also known as the ‘American  Revolution’.   It   was   a   war   tantamount   to  Americans   fighting   one’s   own   king   to   get  back   their   independence. Americans   proved  to the world that the subjects have a right  to   fight   the   rulers   who   deny   them   their  natural rights. It is said that ‘State without  a King’ is a phenomenon, which is a gift to  the world from America.  Canada, a country adjacent to America  was   acquired   by   the   British   by   the   Paris  Treaty   in   1763.   Later,   the   British   accorded  the status of a federal state to Canada and  established a bicameral parliament. They had  also appointed a Governor-General in Canada.  2.3.2 Australia and New Zealand  In the 18 th   century the first colony of the  prisoners   deported   from   England   was  established   in Australia.   Later   in   the   19 th  century   other   regions   in   Australia   were  colonised. The British also established their  colonies in the Island of Tasmania and New  Zealand.   In   the   year   1900   the   island   of  Tasmania was included and the Republic of  Australia was created as an integral nation  of the British Empire. A bicameral parliament  was   established.   A   Governor   -   General   was  appointed in Australia by the British king as  the   viceregal   representative.   Only   European  immigrants were allowed to enter Australia.  In 1907, New Zealand was accorded the  status of an autonomous state integral to the  British empire. The European settlers in New  Zealand   adopted   democratic   system   of  administration.   The   measures   of   public  welfare such as common right to vote, public  railways, fire and accident insurance, pension  for the old, compensation to workers who got  injured or died on duty, etc. were implemented  in New Zealand long before 1900 C.E. Only  European immigrants were allowed to settle  down in New Zealand.  2.3.3 Asia  To protect their colonies in India from  other   colonialist   European   nations   and   to  boost their trade in India and the neighbouring  regions   were   the   main   objectives   of   the  British rulers.  Myanmar   :   Myanmar   is   India’s  neighbouring country on its northeast boundary.  Earlier it was known as ‘Brahmadesh’ (Burma).  The British wanted to establish their control in  Burma because it was rich in natural wealth  and was also a potential market.  The   royal   dynasty   of   Myanmar   had  successfully   consolidated   the   country   under  their rule. It also conquered Manipur. Later  they attacked Assam. The British were alerted  by the Burmese attacks. Hence, Lord Amherst,  the Governor-General of India declared war  against Myanmar. The war continued for two  years.   It   is   known   as   the   ‘First   Anglo-  Burmese War’. The British navy conquered  the port of Rangoon (Yangon) in this war.  It   ended   with   a   treaty   between   the   British  and the Burmese king. Manipur was returned  to the British. The coastal region, the forests  and mines there, came under British control.  The   British   collected   a   large   sum   as  compensation   against   military   expenditure  from   Myanmar.   They   also   appointed   their  Resident in Inwa (also known as ‘Ava’), the  capital of Myanmar at that time.  The   ‘Second Anglo-Burmese   War’ was  fought during Lord Dalhousie’s tenure. Two  British   individuals   staying   in   Burma   were  asked   to   pay   a   fine   by   the   Burmese  administration. This minor incident was used  as a pretext by Dalhousie to plan an attack

15  Do you know   ?  The   British   imprisoned   King   Thibaw  after his defeat. So as to ensure that he  would not be able to rise against the British  or to have any contact with his subjects,  he was brought to Ratnagiri in Maharashtra.  A   three   storeyed   palace   was   built   there.  King Thibaw was kept under house arrest  in   that   palace.   The   ground   floor   of   the  palace has a large hall with marble floor.  The   roof   is   decorated   with   beautifully  carved   wooden   panels.   The   windows   are  hemispherical   having   panes   of   colourful  Italian   glass. An   image   of   Lord   Gautam  Buddha brought by the king from Myanmar,  is installed   in the precincts of the palace.  You may note, that the British adopted  similar   policy   when   they   sent   Emperor  Bahadur   Shah   to   Yangon   after   the   1857  Independence War.   He could never return  to India and died there.  Lokmanya   Tilak,   who   was   born   in  Ratnagiri was kept in the  jail   at   Mandalay   in  Myanmar with a view to  keep   him   away   from   the  Indian   Movement   of  Independence. Tilak   wrote  ‘Geetarahasya’   in   this  prison.   Later,   Netaji  Subhash   Chandra   Bose  was also sent to Mandalay  jail.  Thibaw Palace, Ratnagiri  on Myanmar. He declared war and sent an  army to Myanmar with Commodore George  Lambert at its head. The Burmese army was  defeated.   The cities of Rangoon (Yangon),  Pegu (Bago) and Prome were captured by the  British. This region was merged in the British  Empire. With this victory the British influence  in the coastal region of Myanmar was firmly  established.   The   British   army   fighting   this  war   was   comprised   of   Indian   soldiers.   Not  only   that,   the   expenditure   of   this   war   was  also borne by the Indians.  The   French   had   already   created  considerable influence in Vietnam (Indochina).  There   was   increasing   contact   between   the  Burmese   king   and   the   French.   In   addition,  King Thibaw of Myanmar tried to strike a  pact   with   Italy   and   Germany.   These   were  reasons enough for the British to feel alarmed.  They   got   a   pretext   to   declare   war   against  King   Thibaw   when   he   levied   fine   on   the  Bombay-Burma   Trading   Corporation,   a  British company. Lord Dufferin, the Governor-  General   and   Viceroy   of   India   took   this  opportunity and sent army to attack Burma.  The ‘Third Anglo-Burmese War’ was fought  around 1885 C.E.   The British conquered the  city of Mandalay. King Thibaw surrendered  and   the   entire   region   of   North   Myanmar  became an integral part of the British Empire.  In   1935   an   act   was   passed   to   separate  Myanmar from Indian territory.  Myanmar   was   inspired   by   the   ‘Indian  Freedom Struggle’ and gained independence  in 1948.  Nepal :   Nepal was a small kingdom in  the Himalayan region. The British had sent  their   representatives   to   Nepal   but   they   did  not receive any reciprocal response. It led to  two Anglo-Nepalese wars.  The   Gurkha   army   had   mere   10-12

=== Page 26 ===

16  thousand soldiers while the British army was  much larger having more than 30 thousand  soldiers.   The   British   attacked   Nepal.   The  Nepalese army brought the British army to  the point of desperation. Nepal was defeated  by British Nepal at Makwanpur in 1816. The  British   took   over   the   regions   of   Terai,  Kumaun   and   Garhwal.   A   British   Resident  was appointed at Kathmandu. In 1923, the  British accepted the sovereignty of Nepal.  Sikkim :   The British goal was to gain  control   over   India’s   neighbouring   regions.  Sikkim was a small kingdom on the north  border   of   India,   which   was   surrounded   by  Bhutan,   Bengal,   Nepal   and   Tibet.   In   1815  the King of Sikkim handed over the region  around Darjeeling to the British. In return the  king was granted certain amount as a privy  purse.   Later   Lord   Dalhousie   sent   army   to  Sikkim and took hold of some more regions  of   Sikkim.   This   threw   open   the   Sikkim  markets to the British traders and authorised  the British to collect octroi on the India-Tibet  trade. In 1886 the Tibetans tried to capture  Sikkim. The British immediately took action  against them. In the 1890 treaty between the  British and China it was agreed that Sikkim  will be a British protectorate. In this way the  British could ensure the security of the tea  gardens in Darjeeling. Sikkim was made a  buffer zone and the British took control of  the internal administration and foreign policies  of Sikkim. However, the sovereign status of  Sikkim was maintained.  A plebiscite was held in 1975 and the  people of Sikkim voted for merging in the  Indian   Republic.   Thus,   Sikkim   became   a  constituent state in the Indian federation.  Bhutan   :   Bhutan   is   a   neighbouring  country   of   India,   located   near   its   northern  border   and   to   the   east   of   Sikkim.   Lord  Warren Hastings, the first Governor-General  of India had recognised the geographic and  economic   importance   of   Bhutan.   Hence,   he  established   friendly   relationship   with   the  country.   It   helped   to   open   the   trade   route  from Bengal to Tibet for the British. In 1841,  Ashley Eden took an agressive stand against  Bhutan.   There   was   a   war   between   Bhutan  and   the   British   in   1865.   The   war   was  concluded with a treaty, according to which  the king of Bhutan surrendered the territories  conquered by Bhutan to the British and the  king was granted an annual subsidy. Later,  in another treaty in 1910, the British agreed  not   to   interfere   in   the   internal   matters   of  Bhutan and Bhutan agreed to be guided by  the British in their external affairs. In 1949,  the   treaty   was   signed   on   8th August   1949  between   India   and   Bhutan,   according   to  which   India   assumed   a   position   of   an  advisory to Bhutan in the matters of defence  and external affairs.  Tibet :   Tibet was under the influence of  Dalai   Lama.   The   British   wanted   to   have  hold on Tibet for arresting Russian advances  and to increase their own trade. During Lord  Curzon’s   times   the   British   military   had  reached ‘Lhasa’, the capital city of Tibet. In  1907, as per the treaty between England and  Russia, the political rule of China in Tibet  was   principally   acknowledged.   It   gave   a  leeway to China to claim Tibet as an integral  part of China.  2.3.4   Africa  European travellers reached Africa also.  However, the African territory with its dense  forests, widespread lakes, swamps and deserts  was unfamiliar to them. Leopold II, the king  of Belgium had Congo under his dominance.  He convened a Geographical Conference in  Brussels in 1876. European geographers and  researchers had gathered in this assembly. It  was decided there to establish an institution  called   ‘International   Association   for   the  Exploration   and   Civilisation   of   Central  Africa’, for the purpose of dissemination of  knowledge in Africa. In 1884 a conference  of European nations was organised in Berlin  to explore the opportunities in Africa available  to them. The true purpose of this conference  was   to   discuss   the   possibilities   of   dividing  the African territory amongst themselves.

=== Page 27 ===

17  In   the   Berlin   Conference   the   Belgian  supremacy in Congo was acknowledged by  all and Congo was renamed as ‘Congo Free  State’. It was also decided in this conference  that if any of the European nations fails in  utilising the natural resource in the colonies  under   their   charge,   then   that   nation   should  give it up to another European nation.  George Taubman   Goldie   was   a   British  citizen   who   founded   ‘The   National African  Company’ in England. A charter was issued  to him by the British government permitting  to   conduct   trading   operations   in   Nigeria.  Later,   the   company   was   acquired   by   the  British   Government.   Nigeria   became   a  colony governed by the British government.  Bismarck,   the   Chancellor   of   Germany  established the first German colony in West  Africa   in   1883.   It   was   named   ‘Togoland’.  Germany   also   established   its   colonies   in  Cameroon and southwest Africa.  France   established   their   supremacy   in  Senegal,   Gambia   and   in   the   region   to   the  north of Congo. In 1883, Ivory Coast also  became   a   French   colony.   Later   France  acquired   the   region   of   Dahomey   from  Portugal.   Till   1914,   France   had   established  their   control   over   the   region   from   Sahara  desert to Ivory Coast to the west and French  Guinea.  Cape Colony and Natal in East Africa  were   held   by   England   while   Mozambique  was under Spanish control. England, France  and Germany were interested in the regions  of East Africa. These three nations made a  pact   to   protect   each   other’s   interests.  Accordingly,   the   Sultan   of   Zanzibar   was  given   Pemba   island   and   the   coastal   region  of east Africa, while   Madagascar was given  to France, the coastal region of north Africa  to England and the   south region to Germany.  In 1897, Germany took over the east African  region from ‘German East Africa Company’.  England   declared   Zanzibar,   Pemba   island  and Nyasaland (Malawi) as their protectorates  and   it   came   to   be   known   as   ‘British   East  Africa’.  Morocco, Algeria, Tunis, Tripoli (Nubia)  and Egypt were part of the north region of  Africa. In 1830 France had already established  control   over   Algeria.   Italy,   France   and  England   wanted   to   occupy   Tunis.   In   this  competition France was successful, and got  hold   of   Tunis   from   its   Turkish   Sultan.  Thereafter, France took hold of Morocco as  well. Italy conquered Tripoli and Cyrenaica.  Both England and France wanted to gain  hold   over   Egypt.   The   British   built   railway  from Alexandria to Cairo. Suez Canal that  joined Mediterranean and Red Sea was built  under the supervision of the French diplomat  Ferdinand de Lesseps. In the beginning Egypt  bore the expenditure for this project.  However, later the expenditure for Suez  Canal   got   so   escalated   that   Egypt   had   to  seek loans to meet it. It became impossible  to repay even the interest on the loans, so  Egypt   put   up   the   shares   of   ‘Suez   Canal  Company’   for   sell.   England   purchased   a  number   of   shares   and   thus   gained   part  ownership   of   the   company   and   the   Suez  Canal. Egypt became independent in 1922.  Sudan   to   the   south   of   Egypt   was   its  vassal state. England, by the virtue of Egypt  being   deemed   as   British   protectorate,   had  also   assumed   the   same   role   in   Sudan.  Sudan   was   important   for   England   because  the Nile, the lifeline of Egypt, originates in  Sudan. England, without paying heed to local  opposition   established   its   supremacy   over  Sudan.   To   facilitate   the   moving   of   British  army in Sudan, the British began to build a  railway track from Uganda to Sudan. France  accepted England’s claim on Sudan and in  exchange   asked   for   some   facilities   in   the  western parts of Africa.  Cape Colony and Natal in the southern  parts   of Africa   were   under   British   control.  Orange Free State and Transvaal were under  Dutch   control.   Gold   mines   were   discovered  in   Johannesburg   and   it   attracted   European  nations to South Africa. By 1909, resulted in  England’s decision to consolidate its colonies  in the southern region and name it ‘Union

19  In the previous lesson, we learnt about  European   Colonialism   and   its   impact   on  world history.   In this lesson, we are going  to learn about the spread of colonialism in  India and its impact.  3.1 Portuguese  Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese seafarer  reached the port of Calicut (Kozhikode) in  1498. Once landed on the Indian coasts the  Portuguese   did   not   take   long   to   establish  themselves   in   India.   By   the   beginning   of  16 th   century   Portuguese   had   brought   a  considerable   portion   of   the   Indian   coasts  under their control.  The Portuguese, took advantage of the  strained relations among various rulers in  South India. They established their colonies  on   the   western   coast   and   built   forts   for  their   protection   and   used   them   to   protect  their colonies from external attacks and   to  reinforce   them   continuously   with   supplies  by   using   seaways.   The   Portuguese   naval  force was very strong. They used to launch  sudden   attacks   on   their   enemy’s   territory  from the sea and wreck it completely.   The  Indian   local   rulers   could   not   match   the  Portuguese in their war tactics. When they  established their firm control on the Indian  Ocean,   they   made   it   obligatory   for   the  Indian rulers to get license (Cartaz) from  them   for   sailing   on   the   Indian   Ocean.   If  the local rulers dared to set out on the sea  without a Portuguese license, the ships were  either   seized   or   sunk   by   force.   The  Portuguese   had   become   so   powerful   that  even the mighty Mughals, and the Sultanates  in   the   south   had   to   buy   a   license   from  them.   By   1608,   the   Portuguese   had   their  colonies on the western coast of India at  Diu, Daman, Chaul, Goa (including Sashti  and Bardesh), Honnavar,   Gangoli, Basrur,  Mangalore,   Kannur,   Kodungallur,   Cochi  and Kollam. Similarly on the eastern coast  they   had   trader   colonies   at   Nagpattinam,  Mylapore (Mayilappore or also Sao Tome/  San   Thom),   and   Hugli   in   Bengal.   This  stretch   of   the   Portuguese   Empire   had   its  capital at Goa.

India and European Colonialism  3.1 Portuguese  3.2 British  3.3 Dutch  3.4 French  The   Portuguese   colonies   had   spread  from   Cape   of   Good   Hope   to   Macau   in  China. They all were considered to be part  of   the   Indian   Empire   of   the   Portuguese  (Estado da India). There were several office  holders appointed by the Portuguese king :  ‘Vice-rei ’   Capitaon-i-jaral’   (Viceroy   and  General of the Army) for 3 years tenure.  There   used   to   be   an   advisory   board   to  assist   the   Vice-rei,   which   included   the  Archbishop   (Arcebispo)   of   Goa,   Judge  (Chancellor),   In-charge   of   Company’s  possessions (Vedore da Fazenda),   Captain  (Capitaon)   and   a   few   aristocrats   from  Do you know   ?  Cartaz :   The document of a Cartaz  usually carried details like the name of the  vessel (ship), the name of the captain of  the ship, port of departure and arrival, the  list   of   weaponry   on   the   ship   loaded   for  the purpose of self-defence, etc.

20  Portugal. Vice-rei used to be the presiding  head of this administrative set up.  In the earlier half of the 17 th   century  five ships used to arrive every year in the  Indian   ports.   These   ships   were   equipped  with   canons.   The   Portuguese   had   ship  building facilities at Goa, Diu and Daman.  Durable teakwood of best quality, essential  for   building   ships   was   available   in   these  regions.   The   Portuguese   used   to   deploy  seamen   from   Portugal   to   India.   In   those  times,   Indian   rulers   did   not   maintain   a  naval force, therefore, Indian rulers found  it difficult to fight the strong naval forces  of the Portuguese. Only one exception was  that of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, who  had built his own navy. The Dutch and the  British defeated the Portuguese naval forces  in the 17th century in the sea-battles.  The Portuguese prohibited building of  any religions monument except churches in  the Indian provinces under their rule. They  also   prohibited   celebrations   of   religious  festivals   or   wedding   functions.   The  Portuguese rulers also tried to suppress the  local   languages.   People   were   offered  employment,   with   the   intention   to   attract  them to Christianity.   In the beginning of  their rule they made Goa a free port. That  resulted in attracting traders from various  countries to Goa.  3.2 British  The   British   established   ‘East   India  Company’ on 31 st   December 1600.   Queen  Elizabeth granted permission to the company  to trade in the eastern countries.  In   the   beginning   the   East   India  Company’s operations were limited to send  their cargos to the eastern countries, to sell  the British goods in those countries, to buy  spices with the profits earned there and the  cash carried from home, to sell the spices  in England and to earn profits. The sailboats  of those days needed to plan their forward  and backward voyages in specific periods  of the year. Therefore, to carry out trade  transactions was more tedious.   Under such  circumstances the British were in need of  a permanent place to build warehouses to  store the goods bought at low prices. The  British   boats   used   to   sail   from   England  during   the   months   of   December   to April  and used to return to England after an year  in the month of January after completing  trading transactions in India. This required  that they to stay in India over a period of  9-13 months. Hence, the company decided  to   build   their   ‘factories’ (emporiums   –   a  place where goods are bought, stored and  sold.) in India. The staff of the factories  were called ‘factors’. In 1623, the British  government,   under   the   civil   and   military  law, granted the company an authority of  adopting   punitive   measures   for   the   erring  staff.   The   company   was   also   given   the  right of monopoly to trade in the eastern  countries. Charles II, the king of England,  issued a charter allowing the company to  build forts in India, to maintain an army  and to make treaties with non-Christians.  Do you know   ?  Portuguese   Trade   :   The   king   of  Calicut wrote to the King of Portugal  in a letter sent with   Vasco-da-Gama,  “Our state is rich in spices like cloves,  ginger,   black   pepper   and   precious  stones.   We   expect   you   to   pay   us   in  gold, silver, corals in exchange for our  spices and precious stones.” Vasco-da-  Gama sold the commodities in Portugal,  which he carried from India. He could  earn   huge   amount   of   profit   in   that  trade, which was sixty times more that  the   money   he   spent   for   his   return  journey to Portugal.

In the latter half of the 17 th   century, the  company operated from Surat and Chennai  (Madras) . The eastern coast, Odisha, Bengal  in India and other eastern countries were  under   the   company’s   jurisdiction.   The  factories   at   Rajapur   in   Maharashtra,   port  city of Mokha (Mocha in Yemen) in the Red  Sea,   Basra   in   the   Persian   Gulf   were  controlled   by   the   Surat   centre. The   Surat  factory staff comprised of an accountant, an  in-charge   of   the   stores,   a   treasurer,   some  factors and clerks. In addition there was a  Christian priest, a surgeon and his assistant,  cooks,   Company   President’s   personal  servants and a trumpet blower.  commodities except those which were banned  by the company (such as textiles, indigo,  spices, wool, lead, corals, ivory, etc.).  The   company   started   building   forts  in India as part of their strategy. They built  a fort   and a factory in Chennai. The fort  was named as ‘Fort St. George’.   A mint  was   also   established   in   Chennai.   The  British   issued   their   own   coinage   of   gold,  silver, alloys and copper from this mint.  Try to do this :  The currency of various countries is  known by specific names. Prepare a list  of countries and their currencies.  In 1661, Charles II, the king of England  was engaged to Braganza, the Princess of  Portugal. The   king   of   Portugal   gifted   the  islands   of   Mumbai   to   Charles   II   on   this  occasion. Abraham Shipman, an Englishman  was assigned 500 soldiers and was appointed  as   the   ‘Governor   of   Bombay’.   In   1665,  Mumbai was fully under the British control.  Mumbai comprised seven islands, namely,  Mumbai,   Mahim,   Paral,   Wadala,   Worli,  Sion (Shiv) and Mazgaon. Charles II leased  Mumbai to the East India Company because  the   expenditure   for   its   maintainance  exceeded than the income earned from it.  In 1669, the company appointed Sir George  Oxenden   as   Governor   of   Surat   and  Commander-in-Chief of Mumbai. A British  mint was established in Mumbai and coins  of silver, copper and zinc were issued from  there.   This   encouraged   merchants   and  artisans   to   come   and   settle   down   in  Mumbai. The company had 5-6 small ships  and   around   300   soldiers   to   ensure   the  security   of   Mumbai.   The   soldiers   were  given guns and swords.  3.3 Dutch  In 1602, several Dutch companies came  together to form a company, named ‘United  Do you know   ?  Factory   :   The   British   used   to  acquire   large   plots   of   land   for   their  factories.   These   plots   were   used   to  build   warehouses,   residential   quarters  and offices were built on these plots.  The   main   building   of   the   factory  carried   ‘Union   Jack’.   The   meals  provided to the staff included bread,  meat,   rice,   khichadi   of   pulses   and  rice, pickles, etc. Company had created  beautiful gardens for the benefit of the  staff at Surat, Karwar, Machilipatnam,  Petapuli, Chennai and Mumbai.  The British citizens were also appointed  in the factories as apprentices, clerks and  factors. Everybody, right from the President  to apprentices lived in the factory premises.  All   were   provided   food   by   the   company  mess. They were permitted to trade various

22  East India’.   The Dutch government issued  a license to the company to conduct trading  with the eastern countries. The same license  permitted them to appoint staff, to establish  factories, to build forts, to engage in battles  against   the   eastern   countries   and   also   to  sign   treaties   with   them.   Accordingly   the  company, appointed a Governor-General to  take   care   of   the   Indian   affairs.   By   the  middle of the 17 th   century the company had  established   Dutch   colonies   and   factories  right   from   the   eastern   coast   of Africa   to  Japan.   It   encompassed   the   present   day  regions   of   Mozambique,   South   Africa,  Yemen,   Iraq,   Iran,   Pakistan,   India,  Bangladesh,   Myanmar,   Siam,   Vietnam,  Laos,   Cambodia,   Taiwan,   China,   Japan,  Indonesia   and   Malaysia.   The   Dutch   built  various buildings in the premises of their  factories and also fortification walls around  them.   They   installed   canons   on   the  fortification walls for security. The Dutch  also had native people in their staff. They  established   their   first   factory   in   1602   at  Petapuli in the northern parts of Coromandel  coast.   Their   other   factories   were   built   in  Machilipatnam,   Pulicat,   Thirupapuliyur,  Port   Nova,   Karikal,   Agra,   Ahemdabad,  Bharuch, Chinsura,   Thatta,   Khambayat,  Surat   and   Nagapattan.   They   obtained  permission from the Vijaynagara court and  built forts in Pulicat and Nagapattan. Later,  they defeated the Portuguese and acquired  the forts at Kochi, Kodunglur, Kannur and  Kollam.   They   also   obtained   monopoly   in  black   pepper   trade   by   entering   a   treaty  with the king of Kochi. At the beginning  of the 17 th   century the Dutch naval force  was   very   strong.   At   any   given   moment  they could deploy at least 20 war ships and  an   army   of   3-4   thousand   soldiers.   The  Mughal,   Adilshahi   and   Qutubshahi   ships  were   required   to   obtain   license   from   the  Dutch. If any ship was launched without a  license, it was seized by the Dutch.  3.4 French  In 1664 ‘French East India Company’  (La Compagnie des Indes Orientalis) was  established,   with   the   initiative   of   Jean-  Baptiste Colbert, the French finance minister  to King Louis XIV. The company was given  the authority to trade with eastern countries,  to   maintain   army   and   navy   and   also  exemption   from   taxes. The   company   was  also given the authority to enter a war or  treaty with the eastern rulers. In 1666, the  company sent a diplomatic contingent to the  court   of   Mughal   Emperor Aurangzeb   and  obtained the permission to establish a factory  in Surat. The first French factory in Surat  was established in 1668. Then the factories  at Pondicherry (Puducherry), Chandranagar,  Mahe,   Karikal   and   Machilipatnam   were  built.   During   this   period   the   French   were  fighting with the Qutubshahi ruler and the  Dutch. Pondicherry was the main centre of  the French operations. It was ruled by the  Nawab of Karnataka. The members of the  Nawab’s   family   were   fighting   amongst  themselves for the throne.   The British and  the French started intervening in the matter.  It resulted in three battles between the British  and   the   French   from   1744   to   1763   C.E.  These are known as ‘Carnatic Wars’.   The  French were defeated by the British in the  third battle. With the defeat of the French,  there was no European rival left in India for  the British.  In   the   next   lesson,   we   are   going   to  learn   about   the   resistance   to   the   foreign  powers   in   India,   put   up   by   Chhatrapati  Shivaji Maharaj.  Do you know   ?  The   Dutch   established   their   first  colony at Machchlipattinam. This port  city   came   into   existence   in   the   3rd  century B.C.E. It is also mentioned in  ‘Periplus’ of Erythrean Sea as ‘Mosalia’.

24  4.   Colonialism and the Marathas  In the last chapter we learnt about the  spread   of   colonialism   in   India.   Chhatrapati  Shivaji   Maharaj   had   foreseen   the   ulterior  motives of these foreigners and their ways of  infiltration.   He   built   up   strategies   to   arrest  their   advances   in   India.   The   immediate  measures   taken   by   him   in   this   direction  included creation of a strong naval force and  construction of sea forts. He levied octroi on  British   salt   trade   as   a   measure   to   protect  local   salt   trade.   Thus,   Chhatrapati   Shivaji  Maharaj adopted a very strong policy against  the   European   colonisers.   Later,   Chhatrapati  Sambhaji   Maharaj   also   fiercely   fought   the  Portuguese. Chimajiappa, brother of Bajirao  Peshwa I, defeated the Portuguese at Vasai.  The Marathas were the only Indian rulers to  adopt   a   policy   of   resistance   against   the  European colonisers.  4.1 Colonialism vs. the Maratha Empire  Portuguese French, Dutch, British, all of  them came to India as traders. However, they  did not stop at that, in the course of time  they also grabbed the political power.   It is  often   said   that   they   came   to   India   with  weighing   scales   but   used   swords   and  ultimately   seized   the   Indian   throne.   The  Portuguese were the first to arrive in India.  They   were   mentioned   as   ‘Firangis’*   in   the  4.1 Colonialism vs. the Maratha Empire  4.1.1 Portuguese - Maratha Empire  4.1.2 Dutch - Maratha Empire  4.1.3 French - Maratha Empire  4.1.4 British - Maratha Empire  4.1.5 Siddi - Maratha Empire  4.1.6 Afghans - Maratha Empire  You would like to know this:  The foresight of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in his judgement of the Europeans was  hardly shown by other contemporary Indian rulers. His strategy in this regard, is stated very  clearly in   Adnyapatre   :  “The Portuguese, British, Dutch and the Danish are money lenders. However, they are  not like other common moneylenders. They arrive here, with the help of the rulers in this  country.   Their kings are desirous of grabbing land in our country. They want to rule this  country.”  “European traders are going everywhere. They are establishing themselves in foreign  lands. They are very stubborn. Once they acquire a space, they will never let go of it. If  required, they will die but will not leave it. We should keep them at bay, maintaining only  business relations. Never allot them any space near a sea fort. If for any reason they have  to be allotted a plot for their factory, it should never be near entrance of a creek or on the  sea coast. There is not much to worry as long as they keep within their limits. However, at  the first opportunity these people flaunt their military strength with the help of their naval  force, canons and ammunition. They build new sea forts with the help of their naval force.  This is the reason for not allotting them any space, if allotted, it should be far away from  the seacoast and near a village. Precaution has to be taken to see that their establishment  does not cause any nuisance. Do not permit them to erect permanent buildings. They must  accept these conditions, otherwise they are of no use. We should not obstruct them and should  not let them obstruct us. If you find foreign traders in the enemy land during our expeditions  there, a fine should be collected from them. After they pay the fine, they should be sent back  to the factory or the place from where they had arrived. They should not be treated in the  same manner like an enemy is treated”.

25  army   was   organising   an   attack   on   the  Janjira fort against them.  Both the Portuguese and the Marathas,  in   the   matters   of   diplomatic   relations  adopted   policies   to   suit   the   situation.   In  1665, the Portuguese waylaid 13 ships of  the Marathas, while it was passing by the  ports   on   the   Karnataka   coast.   However,  they soon released those ships as they were  scared   of   the   powerful   Maratha   navy.   In  1966,   while   the   Fort   of   Fonda   ruled   by  Adilshah was under siege by Marathas, the  Portuguese   supplied   ammunition   to   the  Adilshahi   Killedar . On the other hand, they  let   Chhatrapati   Shivaji   Maharaj   cross  through their territory when he was returning  after the sack of Surat. When Mirza Raje  Jaysingh   had   attacked   Swarajya,   the  Portuguese extended support to the Marathas.  You would like to know this:  A book written by Cosme da Guarda,  a Portuguese historian is very important  as a source of the history of Maharashtra.  He wrote a book entitled Vide de Celebre  Sevagy (Life of the Celebrated Shivaji).  He   was   the   first   European   author   to  write a biography of Chhatrapati Shivaji  Maharaj. Here are a couple of passages  from this book:  “Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is such  awe-inspiring name that there is hardly  anybody,   who   would   ever   think   of  challenging him.”  “He   (Chhatrapati   Shivaji   Maharaj)  is very impartial when it comes either to  reward or punish a person… He never  left   a   virtue   unrewarded   or   a   crime  unpunished… He is loved by all because  of his valour and humane conduct. He  is   regarded   throughout   India   as   the  greatest   king,   whose   name   was   feared,  and at the same time he was also known  as the one who cared the most for the  welfare of his subjects.”  Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj  historical   documents   of   that   period.   The  regions under Portuguese rule were mentioned  as ‘Firangaan’  *Firang means Indian sword made with Portuguese  blades and hence, ‘Firangis’ means the Portuguese  later applied to all Europeans.  4.1.1 Portuguese – Maratha Empire  The   Portuguese   had   their   forts   at   Diu,  Daman, Sanjan, Atori, Vasai, Karanja, Chaul  etc.   Because   of   these   forts   the   region   of  Bardesh* was well protected. They used to  store all ammunition at Panvel.  *The   northern   region   of   Goa   was   known   as  ‘Bardesh’.  Try to do this:  Make   a   note   of   Chhatrapati   Shivaji  Maharaj’s   thoughts   on   ‘Construction   of  Forts’ from the book entitled, ‘Adnyapatre’.  Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj first came  in   contact   with   the   Portuguese   when   he  established   his   control   on   Kalyan   and  Bhiwandi.   The   Portuguese   were   alarmed  when Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj built a  strong Maratha navy.   Soon, the Portuguese  were brought to a point of despair by the  Marathas.   In   fact,   in   the   beginning   the  Portuguese had extended technological help  for shipbuilding to the Marathas. However,  the Portuguese Governor of Goa, withdrew  this   help.   The   Portuguese   now   promptly  provided help to Siddis when the Maratha

26  The Portuguese established a factory at  Dabhol   by   obtaining   a   sanction   from  Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. At the same  time the local people were unhappy because  of   the   Portuguese   laws,   which   were  favourable   for   religious   conversions.  Therefore,   in   1667   Chhatrapati   Shivaji  Maharaj   decided   to   attack   the   region   of  Bardesh.   People   of   Bardesh   welcomed  Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj wholeheartedly.  Again   in   1669,   when   the   region   of  Dandarajpuri,   under   the   Siddi   rule,   was  under Maratha siege, the Portuguese supplied  war provisions and ammunition to the Siddis.  During   the   Adilshahi   Sultanate   versus  Maratha   conflict,   the   Portuguese,   while  acting neutral, were surreptitiously helping  Adilashah. Prior to that, Gonsalo Martez,  the Portuguese emissary, had met Chhatrapati  Shivaji Maharaj. Both agreed to avoid any  future   conflict   between   them.   Chhatrapati  Shivaji   Maharaj,   with   an   intention   of  uprooting the Portuguese rule, started sending  small   groups   of   his   men   to   Goa.   It   was  decided that once their number was enough  in Goa, they should strike a revolt against  the Portuguese rule. The Portuguese viceroy  somehow became aware of the plan. Hence,  the plan failed. A treaty was signed between  the Portuguese and the Marathas on 10th  February   1670.   The   following   conditions  were agreed upon – if either of them have  plundered the other’s ships, then the victim  party should be properly compensated, all  those concessions given to the Mughal ships  in transit should also be given to the Maratha  ships,   no   help   be   extended   to   the   Siddis  against the Marathas and not to build forts  in the territory of Ramnagar (presently a  village in Jawhar Tehsil, Thane). There was  a   dispute   about   the   issue   of   collecting  Chauthai* between the Portuguese and the  Marathas which remained unresolved till the  end. To resolve this issue Chhatrapati Shivaji  Maharaj   had   appointed   Pitambar   Shenavi  and Jivaji Shenavi as mediators. However,  they   were   not   much   successful   in   their  negotiations. In 1679, the Portuguese secretly  helped the British in their conflict with the  Marathas for Khanderi-Underi islands.  *Chauthai is a type of revenue collected from the  external   territories,   protected   by   the   Maratha   rulers.   It  used to be one fourth of the total income of the tax payer.  Chhatrapati   Shivaji   Maharaj   had  determined to humble the Portuguese. There  were   many   reasons   for   it,   such   as,   the  Portuguese opposing the construction work  by   the   Marathas   in   Chaul,   forcing   their  subjects   in   Goa   for   religious   conversion,  and   pillaging   of   the   trading   ships.   The  Marathas   defeated   the   Portuguese   during  the siege of Fonda fort.  The Maratha army gathered at Fonda  in   1680.   Chhatrapati   Shivaji   Maharaj,  himself was to lead the campaign, but for  some reasons it could not happen.  The   panic   felt   by   the   Portuguese  because of the warfare skills of Chhatrapati  Shivaji Maharaj is clearly reflected when  the Portuguese Governor said, “Chhatrapati  Shivaji   Maharaj   was   no   doubt   a   mighty  warrior but his strategies against the enemy  during the peaceful times were much more  daunting. Now his death has relieved the  Portuguese authorities from his terror.”  The Portuguese were in alliance with  Aurangzeb,   the   Mughal   emperor,   against  Chhatrapati   Sambhaji   Maharaj. Therefore,  the   Marathas   decided   to   act   against   the  Portuguese.   Hence,   Chhatrapati   Sambhaji  Maharaj attacked Revdanda. The Portuguese  reacted   by   putting   the   Fonda   fort   under  siege. The Maratha army successfully broke  through the siege and attacked Goa. Yesaji  Kank, the chief of Maratha infantry and a  very close associate of Chhatrapati Shivaji  Maharaj,   fought   with   great   valour.   The  Portuguese   governor   was   injured   on   the  battlefield.   He   had   to   beat   a   retreat.  Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj chased the  Portuguese   army,   which   got   trapped   in   a

27  Chimajiappa  deadlock.   However,   the   news   of   Mughal  attack   on   south   Konkan   was   received   in  the   Maratha   camp.   Chhatrapati   Sambhaji  Maharaj and his army, who were on the  verge   of   conquering   Goa   had   to   leave  halfway and rush to fight the Mughals.  Later, the conflict between the Marathas  and the Portuguese was renewed during the  reign   of   Chhatrapati   Shahu   Maharaj.   A  treaty   was   signed   between   the   Marathas  and   Husain   Ali   Sayyad,   the   chief  representative of the Mughals in the south,  which gave the right of collecting chauthai  to   the   Marathas   from   Kalyan-Bhiwandi  region.   Accordingly   they   asked   the  Portuguese to make the payment. However,  the   Portuguese   governor   of   Vasai   refused  to   pay.   To   counter   the   Marathas,   the  Portuguese   established   outposts   in   Vasai,  Asheri,   Tarapur,   Kelwe,   Mahim,   Daman  and Chaul (Revdanda). They also increased  the intensity of their atrocities on the local  people.  Chimajiappa,   the   younger   brother   of  Peshwa   Bajirao   I,   was   assigned   the  responsibility of the campaign against the  Portuguese. At the onset of the campaign  Chimajiappa took over the fort at Thane.  In March 1737, the Maratha army conquered  the   Sashti   island.   On   another   front  Shankaraji   Phadke   entered   Vasai   island.  However, taking over Vasai was not enough  to establish a permanent control over the  Portuguese   territory   until   there   was   a  complete   victory  over   the   fort   of  Vasai.   The  Marathas   fought  valiantly but their  naval   force   was  not strong enough.  The   Maratha  siege   of   Vasai  fort continued for  two years and in  the   end   the   Marathas   defeated   the  Portuguese.  4.1.2 Dutch - Maratha Empire  It was inevitable for the Dutch to have  a contact with the Maratha rule when they  established   a   factory   in   Vengurla.   This  factory   was   established   in   1649   and   the  Dutch trade had flourished there. However  their   trade   was   affected   adversely   when  Chhatrapati   Shivaji   Maharaj   attacked  Kudal.  In 1665 the Mughal governor ( subhedar )  of Surat asked for help from the Dutch for  destroying the Maratha naval force. However,  the   Dutch   offered   no   help.   Chhatrapati  Shivaji Maharaj had allowed them to build  a factory at Dabhol but for some reasons it  never   functioned.   The   political   relations  between the Dutch and the Marathas were  subject to change to suit the need of the  time.   The   Dutch   expected   help   from   the  Marathas   to   evacuate   the   British   from  Mumbai. The Marathas did not harm the  Dutch factory when they ransacked Surat for  the second time. Also during their Karnatak  campaign the Marathas ensured the safety  of the Dutch factory and also issued them  trading permits. For these favours, the Dutch  paid tributes to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.  The   Dutch   factories   at   Porto   Novo   /  Parangipettai   and   Tegnapattam   /  Devanapattinam   were   left   unharmed   by  Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.  4.1.3 French   -   Maratha Empire  In   1668,   the   French   established   their  factory   at   Rajapur   by   seeking   permission  from   Chhatrapati   Shivaji   Maharaj.   They  supplied ammunition to Swarajya in return.  The   Marathas   remaining   true   to   their  friendly relations with the French left the  French   factory   unharmed   during   their  second attack on Surat. In return the French  paid   a   big   tribute   to   them.   In   1677,  Francois Martin, the Governor General of

=== Page 38 ===

28  Puducherry obtained permission for opening  a factory there and assurance of its safety.  After the southern campaign by Chhatrapati  Shivaji Maharaj, Maratha supremacy was  established   on   the   coast   of   Coromandel  (Cholamandalam). Later, the rivalry between  the British and the French got extended to  their   colonies   in   India   as   well.   They  competed for dominance on various Indian  territories.   Both   began   to   interfere   in   the  administration of the local kingdoms. The  French   gained   entry   into   the   courts   of  Nizam   under   the   pretext   of   imparting  military training.  Ibrahim   Khan   Gardi,   a   mercenary  trained   under   the   French   was   hired   by  Sadashivraobhau   Peshwa   in   the   Maratha  army as the chief of artillery. In the Third  Battle   of   Panipat   Mahadji   Shinde   had  observed Ibrahim Khan’s skills. Inspired by  it, he built a trained army with the help  of   de   Boigne,   a   French   military   trainer  and   also   established   a   well   equipped  artillery.   Backed   by   his   trained   army,  Mahadaji   Shinde   could   establish   Maratha  power in north India. He was also successful  in keeping the British under control.  4.1.4 British – Maratha Empire  The   political   relations   between  Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and the British  began due to the Afzal Khan episode. Prior  to the meeting between Maharaj and Afzal  Khan,   Dabhol   was   conquered   by   the  Maratha   army.   At   that   time   there   were  three ships of Afzal Khan unloading in the  Dabhol   port.   On   receiving   the   report   of  Afzal   Khan’s   death,   Mahamud   Sharif   his  representative in Dabhol, took hold of the  ships along with the wealth and goods on  it and fled to Rajapur. Fazal Khan, Afzal  Khan’s   son,   asked   Abdul   Karim,   the  Subhedar of Rajapur, to unload the ships  at Rajapur. The Marathas took advantage  of this opportunity to attack Rajapur and  conquered it. Now, Abdul Karim who had  taken loan from the British, was unable to  repay it. Hence, the British seized one out  of   the   three   ships,   which   were   in Abdul  Karim’s   charge.   Of   course,   this   was  unacceptable   to   the   Marathas   and   they  asked   the   British   to   return   the   ship.   The  British   refused   to   do   so.   Hence,   the  Marathas detained Velaji the local agent of  the   British   at   Jaitapur.   Phillip   Gifford,   a  British officer, visited the Maratha camp to  request   Velaji’s   release   but   he   was   also  detained   there.   Later,   both   of   them   were  released.   However,   this   instance   strained  Maratha-British relations.  When   the   ‘ Panhala   fort’   was   under  siege   laid   by   Adilshah’s   army   and  Chhatrapati   Shivaji   Maharaj   was   trapped  inside the fort, Henry Revington, a British  officer,   Gifford and Velaji were supplying  ammunition to Adilshah’s army. They were  certain   that   there   was   no   escape   for  Chhatrapati   Shivaji   Maharaj   from   this  situation. However, Maharaj was successful  in escaping from Panhala.   Next year, the  Marathas defeated the British in the Rajapur  campaign.   The   British   officers   -   Henry  Revington,   Randolf   Taylor,   and   Phillip  Gifford   -   were arrested and imprisoned for  two years.  Earlier, Lieutenant   Stephen Ustick had  met Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj on Raigad  for   obtaining   permissions   for   the   British  factory.   A   meeting   between   Sundarji   and  Pilaji, representatives of Chhatrapati Shivaji  Maharaj and Ustick was arranged but the  negotiations   in   this   meeting   were   not  successful.  Henry   Oxenden,   a   British   agent,   was  present   in   the   coronation   ceremony   of  Shivaji Maharaj. He obtained the permission  to open a British factory at Rajapur. On  12th June 1674 an agreement was signed  by   the   British   and   the   Marathas.   The  following   terms   and   conditions   were  included   in   the   agreement   :   issuing

=== Page 39 ===

29  permissions   for   the   British   to   trade   in  Swarajya;   to   open   factories   in   Rajapur,  Dabhol,   Chaul   and   Kalyan;   right   of   the  Marathas to levy 2.5% octroi on the British  goods,   etc.   Chhatarapati   Shivaji   Maharaj  prohibited   use   of   British   coinage   in   the  Maratha dominion. He also dismissed some  of the conditions put by the British, such  as, the British goods found afloat from the  wrecked ships should be returned to them  and   the   Marathas   should   enter   a   treaty  with   the   Siddis   of   Janjira.   This   clearly  reveals his resolute policy of safeguarding  Maratha sovereignty.  In   the   times   after   Chhatrapati   Shahu  Maharaj,   when   Nanasaheb   Peshwa   took  charge of administration. The British could  ensure their entry in the political affairs of  the Marathas as Nanasaheb, on one occasion,  sought help from the British. Nanasaheb was

=== Page 40 ===

30  succeded   by   his   second   son   Madhavrao  Peshwa.   However   Nanasaheb’s   younger  brother, Raghunathrao wanted to become the  Peshwa.   Raghunathrao   alias   Raghoba  approached the British for help. It resulted in  appointing a British envoy in the Peshwa  court, in Pune. In 1765 the British took over  the   fort   at   Malvan.   After   the   death   of  Madhavrao   Peshwa,   his   younger   brother  Narayanrao became Peshwa. In his reign,  the British tried to conquer Thane, Vasai,  Vijaydurg and Ratnagiri. In north India, the  Mughal Emperor was under the protection of  Shinde-Holkars. By this time, the British had  become   active   to   get   the   custody   of   the  Mughal Emperor and to reduce the power of  Bhosale dynasty of Nagpur in Bengal.  For the British to bring the region from  Sashti-Vasai   to   Konkan   under   their   sway  was a priority for trading operations. So,  they were already planning and moving in  that   direction.   Raghunathrao   Peshwa   was  offered asylum by the British. The British  army marched from Mumbai to Pune with  Raghunathrao Peshwa in their escort. The  British army and the Maratha army met at  Talegaon-Wadgaon   near   Pune   and   had   a  combat   between   them.   The   British   army  (and   of   course,   Raghunathrao   also)   was  defeated   by   the   Marathas.   A   treaty   was  signed,   which   is   known   as   ‘Wadgaon  treaty’. Later, Nana Phadnavis formed an  alliance   of   four   rulers,   namely,   Peshwa,  Bhosale   of   Nagpur,   Nizam   and   Hyder.  However, the British successfully persuaded  the Nizam to break the alliance. All through  these   happenings   the   British   Governor  Warren   Hastings   had   realised   that   if   the  British had to establish their permanent rule  in   India,   it   was   crucial   to   subdue   the  Marathas. In the battle of Kharda (Taluka  Jamkhed, District Ahmednagar) the Maratha  army   had   a   sweeping   victory   over   the  Nizam in 1795. The British envoy who was  present in the Maratha camp could minutely  observe   and   study   the   military   tactics   of  the Marathas. Later, with the help of this  envoy.   Lord   Wellesley   could   defeat   the  Marathas.  Nana Phadnavis died during the time  of Bajirao Peshwa II. The relations between  Holkar and Bajirao Peshwa II had turned  bitter.   As   a   result   Yashwantrao   Holkar  attacked Pune. Bajirao Peshwa II panicked  and   sought   asylum   from   the   British. The  treaty   signed   by   the   British   and   Peshwa  after this instance is known as ‘Treaty of  Vasai’.   However,   this   treaty   was   not  acceptable   to   Shinde   and   Holkar.   Hence,  there   was   another Anglo-Maratha War   in  1803. The Marathas were defeated in this  war.   The   third   Anglo-Maratha   War   was  fought in 1817. The Marathas were again  defeated and the Maratha rule came to an  end in 1818.   Bajirao Peshwa was granted  an   annual   pension   by   the   British   and   he  spent   rest   of   his   life   in   Bithoor,   near  Kanpur.  4.1.5   Siddi - Maratha Empire  In the latter half of the 15th century  Siddis   arrived   in   India   from   Abyssinia  (Ethiopia). They established themselves at  Janjira.   Chhatrapati   Shivaji   Maharaj   took  over the forts in 1648 at Tale, Ghosale and  Rayari. Siddi was alarmed because of this.  Try to do this:  A few   treaties   were   signed   between  Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and various  colonial powers. Collect information about  these treaties.  In   1671   Maratha   army   blocked   all  approaches to Janjira fort. Siddi, agreed to  surrender the fort to Marathas but at the  same time extended a hand of friendship  to the Mughals and expessed readiness to  be their feudatory. The Mughals agreed to  help him. With the help of Mughals, Siddi  successfully repulsed the Maratha army.  Siddi   and   the   British   always   helped

=== Page 41 ===

31  each   other   against   a   common   enemy.   To  strengthen   the   Maratha   position   against  these   two,   Chhatrapati   Shivaji   Maharaj  began to build a fort on Khanderi island  in   1679.   The   construction   work   was  supervised by Mainak Bhandari. Hughes, a  British officer attempted to shut down the  construction work by stopping the supplies  to the site. The British had to face strong  opposition   from   Mainak   Bhandari   and  Daulat Khan, the chief of Maratha navy.  They   seized   British   ships   and   captured   a  number   of   British   officers.   The   British  deployed   one   big   steamship   and   seven  small   ships.   40-50   small   ships   of   the  Marathas   bravely   confronted   the   British  ships. In the end the British were forced to  beat a retreat from the vicinity of Khanderi  in 1680.  Siddi was increasingly getting difficult.  Hence,   Chhatrapati   Sambhaji   Maharaj  decided to curb his movement and planned  a campaign against him. Siddi was driven  to despair because of the repeated attacks  by the Marathas in the vicinity of Underi,  Apte, Nagothane and Janjira.  While Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj,  was thus planning to crush Siddi for ever,  the   Mughal   army   was   marching   toward  Swarajya.   It   would   have   been   unwise   to  face two enemies on two different fronts.  Hence,   Maratha   army   stopped   chasing  Siddi.  After   Chhatrapati   Sambhaji   Maharaj,  Chhatrapati Rajaram Maharaj and Maharani  Tarabai   were   continuously   engaged   in  combating Aurangzeb. Therefore they could  not   pay   much   attention   to   the   nuisance  created by other enemies.  During the times of Bajirao Peshwa I,  (1733   C.E.)   once   again   the   Marathas  became active against Siddi.   Chimajiappa,  the younger brother of Bajirao Peshwa I,  declared war against Siddi and won it. It  was a great victory. A treaty was signed  by the Marathas and Siddi. Siddi accepted  a feudatory status under the Marathas.  4.1.6 Afghans – Maratha Empire  In   the   first   half   of   the   18th   century,  the mighty Mughal empire had already lost  its glory. The Mughal rule was now limited  only to Delhi, Agra and Punjab. The year  1748 witnessed the first invasion of India  by Ahmadshah Abdali, the king of Afghans.  He   was   defeated   at   Sirhind   by   Shahjada  Ahmadshah the elder son of the emperor.  In 1751 Abdali again invaded India. This  time   the   Mughal   emperor   ceded   the  provinces of Lahore and Multan to Abdali  in order to avoid war. In 1752 the Marathas  and the Mughals arrived at an agreement.  According to that agreement the Marathas  accepted the responsibility to defend north  India, especially the Mughal dominions. In  return Mughal emperor granted the right of  collecting Chauthai from Rohilkhand to the  Marathas and also ceded parts of some of  the   Mughal   provinces.   In   1757   Abdali  again   attacked   for   the   third   time.   He  returned   to   Afghanistan   after   ransacking  the region around Delhi and Mathura. This  time the Maratha army marched from Pune  under   the   leadership   of   Raghunathrao  Peshwa but before they could reach Delhi,  Abdali   had   already   gone   back.   Marathas  took   charge   of   Delhi   and   normalised   the  situation there. Marathas and Sikhs together  planned   a   campaign   to   get   back   Punjab  which was held by Abdali. They conquered  Sirhind   province   and   then   Lahore.   From  there the Maratha army reached Attock.  In 1759, Abdali marched back for the  fourth   time.   Dattaji   and   Janakoji   Shinde,  the   Maratha   nobles   resisted   his   advance.  However, Abdali marched with great speed  and strength and conquered Punjab in no  time. Dattaji Shinde fell on the battlefield.  Abdali took complete hold of Delhi. With  an intention to oust the Afghans permanently,

=== Page 42 ===

32  the Maratha army marched out from Pune  under   the   leadership   of   Sadashivraobhau  Peshwa and Vishwasrao Peshwa. On 14th  January 1761 the Maratha army and Abdali  confronted   each   other   at   Panipat   on   the  banks of river Yamuna. The war between  them   is   known   as   the   ‘Third   Battle   of  Panipat’. Both Peshwas were killed in this  war. A message in code language was sent  to   Pune   announcing   the   loss.   It   was   as  follows : “Two precious pearls fell, twenty  seven gold coins were lost and there is no  count   to   the   loss   of   silver   and   copper  coins”.   Indeed,   the   Marathas   on   the  battleground of Panipat fought with a far-  reaching conviction, which can be described  as ‘India for the Indians’. It was not an  easy task for Abdali to rule Delhi and he  soon returned home. The Maratha opposition  was so fierce that neither Abdali, nor his  successors ever returned to India.  The   British   could   establish   absolute  supremacy in India, once the Maratha rule  declined in the 19th century.   However, the  Indians fought against the British supremacy.  Besides,   they   also   had   to   fight   against  many   internal   evil   practices   and   customs  that were prevalent in the Indian society.  In the next lesson, we will be learning  about   the   social   and   religious   reforms   in  India.  Q.1   (A)   Choose   the   correct   alternative   and  rewrite the statement.  1.

34  his   brother’s   wife  immolating   herself   on  her   husband’s   funeral  pyre (she followed the  custom   of   Sati ),  perturbed   him   very  deeply.   Roy   published  a letter about the evil  practice   of   Sati.   He  was the first Indian to  point out that none of the Indian religious  texts mentioned the practice of Sati as a  prescribed religious obligation. It is because  of his efforts that a law was passed by the  Governor General Lord William Bentinck,  abolishing the practice of Sati, in 1829. He  was also opposed to the practice of child  marriage and segregation of women (Purdah  system).   He   opened   an   English   medium  school. He also launched the first weekly  periodical   in   Bengali.   Later,   he   also  launched   another   publication   in   Persian  language.   He   also   started   a   philosophical  discussion   circle,   named   ‘Atmiya   Sabha’.  This circle became a platform for searching  5.   India : Social and Religious Reforms  The   contribution   of   the   Indian   social  reformers   who   emerged   from   the   first  generation   of   Indians   and   who   studied  under the new educational system introduced  by   the   British   is   very   significant.   The  visionaries in the Indian society were aware  that   political   freedom   was   not   adequate  without the internal transformation. It could  happen through social and religious reforms.  Hence, it is essential that we briefly review  the social-religious reform movements. Raja  Ram Mohan Roy’s efforts was the beginning  point of these movements.  5.1   Call   for   Social   and   Religious  Reforms  The   progress   of   Indian   society   was  stunted   because   of   superstitions,   orthodox  way   of   life,   caste   discriminations,   false  social   notions,   lack   of   curiosity   and  rationality   that   prevailed   on   large   scale.  The social reformers who were trained in  the modern education system introduced by  the   British   developed   a   different   world  view. They felt the need of creating a new  Indian   society   which   cherished   the  progressive   values   of   ‘Freedom,   Equality,  Fraternity and Humanism’. Therefore, they  began   to   work   towards   creating   mass  awareness on various social and religious  issues.  5.2 Age of Reforms  Raja   Ram   Mohan   Roy   was   born   in  Bengal. He translated Sanskrit Upanishads  in   Bengali.   The   experience   of   witnessing  5.1   Call for Social and Religious Reforms  5.2   Age of Reforms  5.3   Religious Reform Movements  5.4   Contribution of Social Reformers  5.5   Contribution of the rulers of Princely  States in India  You would like to know :  The   British   ‘East   India   Company’  made a resolution restricting the freedom  of   the   press   in   1824.   An   appeal   was  submitted   to   the   government   by   Raja  Ram Mohan Roy protesting against the  resolution.   The   appeal   was   also   signed  by Chandra Kumar Thakur, Dwarka Nath  Thakur,   Har   Chandra   Ghosh,   Gauri  Charan   Banerjee   and   Prasanna   Kumar  Thakur.   When   the   Governor   General  ignored the appeal, Roy resubmitted it to  the King of England. Two lines in that  appeal   are   important.   Roy   wrote,   ‘The  rulers   usually   oppose   freedom   of   press  because it may restrain their power’.  Raja Ram Mohan Roy

In   1828,   he   founded   ‘Brahmo  Samaj’ and   proclaimed   that   ‘God   is   one  and there is no need to worship idols to  propitiate him’.  Raja Ram Mohan Roy spoke in support  of   the   anti-colonial   movements   in   the  Spanish   colonies   in   South   America.   He  supported the liberal people in Spain who  were against the monarchical rule.   In 1830  he had gone to England to plead the case  of the Mughal emperor. In recognition of  this the Mughal emperor conferred the title  of   ‘Raja’ on   him.   He   stayed   in   England  for 2 years. Later, he went to France. In  India, he unfolded Europe for the Indians  and   similarly,   whenever   in   Europe,   he  unfolded India to Europeans.  Roy, being trained in the British regime,  laid the foundation of modernity in India  through his writings and work. Organisations  like   ‘Manavdharm   Sabha’,   ‘Paramhamsa  Sabha’   and   ‘Dnyanprasar   Sabha’   were  inspired by his work.  5.3 Religious Reform Movements  Prarthana Samaj :   ‘Prarthana Samaj’  had   its   origin   in   the  ‘Paramhamsa   Sabha’.   It  was founded by Dadoba  Pandurang   Tarkhadkar.  The   founding   members  of ‘Prarthana Samaj’ like  Dr. Atmaram Pandurang,  Justice M.G. Ranade, Dr.  R.G. Bhandarkar opposed  idol   worship   and  emphasised   on   the  principle   of   ‘One   Supreme   God’  (monotheism).   They   opened   orphanages,  schools   for   girls   and   night   schools   for  workers. They   focused   on   the   importance  of   gender   equality,   wiping   out   caste  discriminations   and   also   on   appreciating  the value of mundane life.  Satyashodhak   Samaj   :   In   1873  Mahatma   Jotirao   Phule   founded  ‘Satyashodhak Samaj’ in Pune. It challanged  intellectually and rationally unjust religious  traditions. Mahatma Phule cracked a whip  on the social customs and practices, which  pushed the masses of Indian society into a  miserable state. He showed a new path to  the farmers, artisans, workers and various  suppressed castes for their upliftment. The  characteristics of the Satyashodhak Samaj  included   monotheism,   rejection   of   the  authority   of   Veda-Puranas,   acceptance   of  rationality,   opposition   to   dominance   and  intrusion   of   the   priests   and   idol   worship,  pilgrimage,   disbelief   in   miracles   and  opposition to the notion of a world after  death. Mahatma Phule and Savitribai Phule  took initiative in the movement of education  for   girls   by   starting   a   school   for   them.  They emphasised on the fact that educating  the   girls   is   the   only   way   to   their  emancipation. The work of educating girls  was   continued   by   Pandita   Ramabai   and  Ramabai Ranade.  Dr.R.G.Bhandarkar  Savitribai Phule Mahatma Jotirao Phule  The social system in India was based  on social inequality. Mahatma Phule worked  for   creating   a   social   system   based   on  equality.   His   work   was   continued   by  Gopalbaba   Walangkar,   who   severely  criticised untouchability in his book, ‘Vital  Vidhwamsan’   (Destroying   Defilement).  Shivram   Janba   drew   attention   to   the  problems   of   the   deprived   women   like  Murali, Jogatini and Devdasi.

36  Swami Dayanand  Sarawati  Swami Vivekanand  Arya Samaj :   Swami  Dayanand   Sarawati  founded ‘Arya Samaj’ in  1875.   Arya   Samaj  regarded   Vedas   as   holy  books.   Arya   Samaj  rejected   discrimination  based on caste difference  and encouraged education  of   women,   widow  remarriage and inter-caste marriages.  Ramkrishna   Mission   :   Swami  Vivekanand   established   ‘Ramkrishna  Mission’   in   1897.   Ramkrishna   mission  focused   more   on   serving   needy   people.  They worked for people affected by   famine,  healthcare   for   the   sick  people,   serving   the  weak,   upholding   the  cause   of   education   for  women   and   spiritual  betterment.   It   gave   a  message   to   the   Indian  youth   to   get   up,   to  awaken   and   keep  moving until the goal is  achieved.  Try to do this:  Collect information with the help of  internet and teachers about these people   :  Pandit   Ishwarchandra   Vidyasagar,  Vishnushastri   Pandit,   Veereshlingam  Pantalu   and   Maharshi   Dhondo   Keshav  Karve.  5.4   Contribution   of  Social Reformers  Sir   Sayyad   Ahmad  Khan   :   He   was   born   in  1817   in   Delhi.   He   was  fluent   in   Urdu,   Persian,  Arabic   and   English.   He  had   edited   ‘Ain-i-Akbari’,  a   book   about   Emperor  Akbar’s   administration,  written   by   Abu’l   Fazl.   He   established  ‘Scientific Society’ for Muslims. Members  of   this   society   were   scholars   of   History,  Science and Political Economy. In 1869 he  went   to   England.   After   returning   from  England he founded ‘Mohammadan Anglo  Oriental College’ in 1875. Later it developed  into ‘Aligarh Muslim University’. He started  a periodical entitled, ‘Mohammadan Social  Reformer’. He worked for the propagation  of modern education, science and technology.  Let us find out.  Collect   information   about   ‘Singh  Sabha’ that was founded in Amritsar.  Tarabai   Shinde   :   She   was   born   in  1850   at   Buldhana.   She   wrote   an   essay  comparing the situation of women and men.  In   this   essay   she   wrote   about   women’s  rights. She expressed her thought in a very  upfront   manner.   She   did   not   just   stop   at  discussing   about   reforms   like   widow  remarriage,   women’s   education,   abolition  of   Sati   but   proceeded   to   demand   gender  equality. Considering the time frame of her  essay, it was indeed, very brave step. She  was   the   first   Indian   woman   to   challenge  the   patriarchal   system.   She   opined   that  religious systems suppress women because  religions   are   created   by   men.   Mahatma  Phule   justified   her   thoughts   by   giving  resolute answers to her critics.  Maharshi   Vitthal  Ramji   Shinde   :   He  opened   Marathi  schools   and   schools  for   technical   training  in   Paral,   Deonar   in  Mumbai,   under   the  umbrella of ‘Depressed  Classes   Mission’   that  was   established   by  him. He worked to create public awareness  about   the   issues   affecting   the   depressed  classes, like entry in temples, (for example, Sir Sayyad Ahmad  Khan  Maharshi Shinde

Dr.   Babasaheb   Ambedkar   :  Dr.   Babasaheb Ambedkar   had   determined  to work for creating a society based on the  principles   of  ‘Freedom,   Equality  and   Fraternity’.   He  began   a   movement  for fighting the caste  system and bringing  equality. He gave a  message   from   the  platform   of  ‘Bahishkrut Hitkarini  Sabha’, “Educate yourself, get united and  fight”. This movement led to the ‘Satyagraha  of Chavadar Tank’ at Mahad. He asserted  that the public water bodies should be open  to all. He burnt Manusmruti, the book that  was the source of social inequality in India.  In 1930 he launched a   Satyagraha to open  the ‘Kala Ram Temple’ in Nasik for all.  Karmaveer   Dadasaheb   Gaikwad   headed  this Satyagraha.  Dr.   Babasaheb   Ambedkar   knew   the  importance of print media. For him it was  the   best   instrument   for   creating   public  awareness and to build the movement for  social   equality.   He   began   to   publish   his  own   newspapers,   namely,   ‘Mooknayak’,  ‘Bahishkrut Bharat’, ‘Janata’ and ‘Samata’.  He formed, ‘Independent Labour Party’ for  the good future of the working class. Later  he formed ‘Scheduled Caste Federation’ to  continue   the   work   of   shaping   a   society  based on equality. In 1956, along with his  numerous   followers,   he   got   initiated   to  Buddhism.   Among   his   contributions   the  most   important   is   the   drafting   of   the  ‘Constitution of India’.  Ramaswamy Naikar :   He was born in  ‘Erode’, a city in Tamilnadu in 1879. He  began his work in 1920 as a member of  the Congress. He became  a follower of Mahatma  Gandhi’s   philosophy  and   worked   for  propagating   the   use   of  ‘Swadeshi’   and   for  temple entry to all. He  participated   in   the  ‘Vykom   Satyagraha’   in  Tranvancore,   against  untouchability.   He   started   ‘Swabhiman  Andolan’ in Tamilnadu. He fought against  the   varna   system   and   child   marriage.  People began to address him as ‘Periyar’  (Great Soul) because of his magnanimous  work. He was a great speaker and author.  He   took   a   radical   position   on   the   issues  like women’s rights and family planning.  Kamaladevi   Chattopadhyay   :  Kamaladevi   was   an   active   volunteer   of  Congress. She convinced Mahatma Gandhi  to let women participate  in the salt satyagrha. She  herself participated in the  satyagraha.   She   worked  for   women’s   rights  throughout   her   life.   She  organised   demonstrations  to   draw   attention to   the  problems of workers and  farmers. She was insistent  on   justice   to   female  agricultural   labourers.   Similarly,   she   also  insisted   that   women   working   in   factories  should   have   necessary   facilities.   She  consistently   followed   up   the   issue   of  maternity   leave   to   women.   She   was  imprisoned for one year by the British for  participating in the ‘Quit India’ movement.  5.5   Contribution   of   the   rulers   of  Princely States in India  Maharaja   Sayajirao   Gaikwad   :  Maharaja   Sayajirao   of   Baroda   State   had  adopted   progressive   policies.   He   made  provision of free schooling and free hostels  Ramswamy Naikar  Kamaladevi  Chattopadhyay  Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar

38  for   the   students   from  the   untouchable-tribal  class.   He   also  encouraged   women’s  education   and   also  opened   a   centre   for  physical   training   of  women.   He   started  various   social  programmes,   such   as,  community   feasts   for   all   castes  (‘ sahabhojan ’),   grampanchayat   in   every  village,   literate   grampanchayat   members,  library in every village, compulsory primary  education, compulsory physical training for  boys   and   girls,   ban   on   child   marriage,  widow   remarriage,   etc.   He   also   provided  courses   for   students   from   farmer   families  based   on   agro-industries.   He   passed   a  resolution   for   assuring   a   share   in   the  ancestral   property   to   married   as   well   as  widowed women.  Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj :   The ruler  of the princely state of Kolhapur, Rajarshi  Shahu   Maharaj   supported   Dr.   Babasaheb  Ambedkar’s   leadership,   while   leading   the  ‘Non-brahminical   Movement’ in   his   state.  He made a public declaration of reservations  and   passed   a   resolution   for   free   and  compulsory   primary   education.   He   also  very   strongly   opposed   the   customs   of  ‘ Rotibandi ’ (restrictions on eating together),  ‘ Betibandi ’   (restrictions   on   inter-caste  marriage) and ‘ Vyavasaybandi ’ (restrictions  on   practicing   occupations   other   than   the  ancestral   occupation   of   one’s   caste).   He  made a law for inter-caste marriage. People  in his state were permitted to choose any  occupation.  Thus,   the  social   reformers  created   a   positive  picture for the future  of   our   country.   It  was   necessary   to  build   a   society   with  firm   intellectual   and  rational   base   for  obtaining   freedom  from the British rule.  In   the   next   lesson   we   are   going   to  learn about the freedom movement of the  Indians.  Rajarshi Shahu  Maharaj  Maharaja Sayajirao  Gaikwad  You would like to know  As   far   as   social   reforms   in  Maharashtra   are   concerned,   the   list   of  people, who devoted their lives for it, is  quite extensive. However, it is essential  to   mention   a   few   prominent   names  among   them.   The   contribution   of  Karmveer Bhaurao Patil and Punjabrao  Deshmukh,   Maharshi   Dhondo   Keshav  Karve,   Godavari   Parulekar,   Tarabai  Modak and Anutai Wagh in the field of  education   deserves   a   special   mention.  Sant   Gadge   Maharaj   and   Rashtrasant  Tukdoji   Maharaj   worked   for   creating  social   awareness   through   their   kirtans  and   bhajans.   In   the   field   of   social  service   the   work   of   Dr.   Shivajirao  Patwardhan,   Dr.Baba   Amte   and   Dr.  Rajanikant Arole is of great value. Dr.  Baba   Adhav   started   the   movement   of  ‘Ek Gaon, Ek Panvatha’ (One Village,  One Water Source). R.D. Karve was on  the   forefront   to   inculcate   the   value   of  rationality in people in our social life.  Efforts   of   Dr.   Narendra   Dabholkar  sowed   the   seeds   of   ‘Andhashraddha  Nirmulan’   movement   (movement   for  elimination of superstition).

41  6.   Indian Struggle against Colonialism  In this lesson we will study the Indian  struggle against colonialism.  6.1 Struggle before 1857  In 1818, the British East India Company  took complete charge of Khandesh. The Bhils  in   the   region   of   Satpuda,   Satmala   and  Ajintha united against the British. Trimbakji  Dengale,   an   advisor   of   Bajirao   Peshwa   II,  was imprisoned by the British. He somehow  managed   to   escape   from   the   prison.   Under  the leadership of Godaji and Mahipa, nephews  of   Trimbakaji   Dengale,   the   Bhils   revolted  against the British. There were 8000 of them  who participated in the revolt.  Captain Briggs blocked all the supplies  coming to the Bhils. At the same time Mount  Stuart Elphinston, a British officer adopted a  policy   of   pacifying   the   Bhils.   They   were  recruited to protect the travellers. He offered  them jobs and pensions. However, the policy  of   cornering   the   Bhils   was   also   continued.  Major Morin left no alternative for the Bhils  but   to   surrender.   Around   1822   the   revolt  under   the   leadership   of   Hariya   Bhil   was  crushed by Captain Robinson. Another revolt  of   the Bhils, in which thousands of Bhils  participated,   was   crushed   by   Lieutenant  Outram. However, he also stayed among the  Bhils and won their confidence. He tried to  bring them in the mainstream of urban life.  6.1   Struggles before 1857  6.2   Freedom Struggle of 1857  6.3   Background of Founding the Indian  National Congress  6.4   Founding   of   the   Indian   National  Congress  6.5   ‘Moderates’ and ‘Extremists’  6.6   Armed Revolutionaries in India  6.7   Mahatma   Gandhi:   Non-violent  Resistance Movement  6.8   ‘Quit India’ Movement of 1942  He   adopted   measures   like   declaration   of  amnesty,   land   grants,   agricultural   loans  ( tagai ),   reprieve   from   the   past   crimes   and  recruitment in army to weaken the opposition  from Bhils.  Do you know   ?  Revolt of the Paiks :   Since mediaeval  period there was a system of employing  soldiers known as Paiks (soldiers on call,  who own their weapons), who served the  kings of petty states in Odisha.  They were given free farm lands for  cultivation by these kings. When not on  war, they lived by cultivating these lands.  In the times of war they were called to  fight for their king.  In 1803, the British took over Odisha  from the Bhosale of Nagpur. The British  seized   the   lands   cultivated   by   the   Paiks  for generations. It enraged the Paiks. Also  the salt tax had made salt an unaffordable  commodity   making   daily   life   of   people  miserable.   This   situation   resulted   in   an  armed revolt by Paiks. Bakshi Jagbandhu  Bidyadhar was the leader of this revolt.  Hansaji Naik ruled the region of Nanded.  He refused to merge his territory in Nizam’s  dominion.   He   conquered   some   forts   of   the  Nizam. A war was inevitable. Major Pitman,  Captain   Evans,   Captain   Taylor   with   a  regiment of 400 soldiers joined Nizam for his  protection. The   war   continued   for   25   days.  In the end Hansaji was defeated.  In Satara District the Ramoshi community  revolted under the leadership of Chitursingh.  Santaji Naik and Umaji Naik were among  the   captains   heading   the   Ramoshi   groups.  They   seized   the   consignment   of   some  moneylenders   that   was   in   the   transit   from

42  it, the British government ordered the  peasants   not   to   offer   the   rebels   any  food, clothing, shelter and money. In  addition   people   were   also   threatened  with confiscation of their lands. They  also   ordered   people   to   inform   the  government about Umaji’s whereabouts,  if they come to know of it. Captain  Davis with the help of five companies  of   cavalry   began   chasing   Umaji.  However,   he did not succeed in his  task.   The   rebels   were   continuously   at  war with the British, often changing locations  from Satara, Wai, Bhor to Kolhapur. Captain  Mackintosh took over the task of capturing  Umaji. Umaji ordered his mates to kill the  British officers. However, the British caught  Umaji near Bhor. Umaji was presented in the  court and was sentenced to death. He was  hanged at Pune.  In 1828 Phondsavant Tandulwadikar, the  in-charge   (‘Killedar’)   of   Mahadevgadh  rebelled   against   the   British.   However   the  British promptly crushed it.  Angered   by   the   British   policies,   the  members   of   Sawantwadi   aristocracy   got  together   and   revolted   against   the   British.  However, Spooner*, the British political agent  was successful in crushing it. Even after their  defeat a few of the Sawantwadi aristocracy  reattempted a revolt. By then the British had  imposed   military   law   in   the   area.   Captain  Outram   finally   managed   to   end   the   revolt  permanently.  *A   Political   agent   was   a   representative   of   the   British  government instated in the courts of an Indian princely state.  In   Kolhapur   state,   there   used   to   be  keepers of forts, called ‘Gadkari’. A Gadkari  was a salaried officer in the Maratha regime.  However, the British government took away  the   authority   of   the   Gadkaris   and   stopped  paying   them   salary.   The   first   resistance   to  this decision was raised at Samangadh near  Kolhapur.   Captain   Outram   arrived   with   his  platoons to bring the Gadkaris under control.  However,   in   the   first   run   the   rebels   were  Do you know   ?  Umaji   Naik   had   issued   a   charter  against   the   British.   The   Charter   said,  “Wherever in our country, Europeans, if  spotted,   should   be   caught   and   killed  without   a   concern   to   their   official  position. Whosoever, successfully does it  will be rewarded by the new government  in   way   of   money,   lands   and   Jahagirs.  This   is   an   opportunity   for   those   who  wish   to   reclaim   their   lost   lands,   rights  and   properties   under   the   British   rule.  They may avail of this opportunity. The  British   military   has   recruited   Hindi  soldiers   -   mounted and foot soldiers. They  should   leave   their   jobs   in   the   British  military.   They   should   not   obey   their  superior’s orders. If they do not follow  this instruction then the new government  will punish them. Put the bungalows of  the   Europeans   on   fire.   Loot   the  Government treasury. Whosoever, does it  will be allowed to retain the money with  himself.   Don’t   deposit   the   collected  revenue in the government treasury. It is  obligatory to comply with our orders for  every person, may he be a Hindu or a  Muslim.   It’s   the   time   now   for   the  prediction of a doom for the British rule,  to come true.”  Umaji Naik  Pune   to   Mumbai.   In   1824  Umaji   Naik   seized   the  government   treasury   at  Bhamburde   (presently  Shivajinagar,   Pune).   Both  together, with their activities,  made   the   British   desperate.  To   put   an   end   to   their  activities   the   British  government   declared   an  award of Rs. 5000 each, for  catching   Umaji   Naik   and   his  mates Bhujba, Pandya and Yesaji. Meanwhile  Umaji Naik regularly held meetings with his  people and planned further actions. To stop

Later,   more  platoons arrived from Madras (Chennai) and  the Gadkaris were forced to surrender.  6.2 Freedom Struggle of 1857  The freedom struggle of 1857 was the  result   of   mounting   pressures   because   of  increasing discontent of Indian soldiers in the  British   army   and   also   political,   social,  religious and economic reasons. The treatment  given to Indian soldiers and the restrictions  imposed on them were at the root of their  discontent. The soldiers felt hurt because of  many reasons, such as cuts in their allowances,  being   compelled   to   cross   the   sea,   frequent  humiliation   during   daily   parade,   partiality  ruling large in matters of transfers, being left  out during promotions, etc.  On   the   civil   front,   Lord   Dalhousie  adopted   the   Doctrine   of   Lapse * .   It   created  discontent among the rulers of princely states  who   were   subjected   to   his   policy.   By  implementing this policy Dalhousie annexed  the   states   of   Satara,   Jaitpur,   Sambalpur,  Udaipur,   Nagpur   and   Jhansi   to   the   British  empire.  *Policy of not permitting an adopted son (Dattak) to succeed  a deceased ruler of a princely state unless there was a pre-  approval to such succession by the British Government.  Annexation of the princely states put the  soldiers   in   their   army   out   of   job.   They  returned to agriculture increasing the pressure  on the cultivable land. Gradually, people also  began to believe that through administrative  policies the company government was trying  to destroy their religion. Along with annexing  the states the British government also seized  inherited land holdings, which had made a  large number of Indians unhappy.  The British government tried to introduce  new land revenue systems like ‘Kayamdhara  or   Jamindari’   (permanent   settlement),  ‘Ryotwari’ and   ‘Mahalwari’. These   revenue  systems were formed without any concern to  Indian   tradition   of   revenue   systems,   Indian  cropping cycle and Indian climate. The new  revenue   systems   introduced   by   the   British  made   the   common   farmer   penniless   while  making   the   government   and   the   landlords  rich. Earlier, the land tax could be paid by  way of food grains and other commodities.  Now the farmer had to pay it in hard cash.  Despite   of   good   or   bad   harvest,   there   was  no   option   but   to   pay   the   tax.   More   so   if  there was a famine, the farmer was driven  to a dire condition. Droughts, epidemics used  to   affect   people   and   animals   the   most.  However,   the   British   outlook   used   to   be  absolutely   unsympathetic.   Thus,   the   farmer  was   caught   between   the   government   and  moneylenders. Earlier, selling of agricultural  land   was   not   allowed.   Now   the   British  government   defined   agricultural   land   as  sellable. The farmers who were in difficult  situation   had   no   alternative   but   to   sell  portions of their land, for getting some hard  cash.   Lands   thus   acquired,   were   used   for  cultivation of cash crops like indigo by the  British   owners.   The   labourers   employed   on  their   plants   were   exploited   to   the   utmost.  Their   conditions   were   miserable.  Unemployment,   despair,   disbelief   loomed  large all over India, which had made the life  of common people very difficult.  Try this.  Collect   more   information   about  ‘Kayamdhara’,   ‘Ryotwari’,   ‘Mahalwari’  land revenue systems and discuss it in the  class. Also discuss the present land system  of ‘Anewari’.  Not only the monetary exploitation but  also   forced   religious   conversions,   British  policies with regard to Indian customs and  traditions   contributed   to   the   increasing  discontent among Indian people.  In the year 1856, Indian soldiers in the  British army were given long range Enfield  rifles and new cartridges for loading in these  rifles. A rumour spread in army camps that  these new cartridges are smeared with cow

44  and pig fat. In order to load the gun with a  cartridge,   one   had   to   break   it   open   with  teeth.   The   idea   of   breaking   a   cartridge  smeared with cow or pig fat, with one’s teeth  was repugnant to Indian soldiers for religious  reasons. The Indian soldiers who refused it  were forced to do so by the British. Finally,  in   the   month   of   March   of   1857,   Mangal  Pandey,   who   was   posted   in   Barakpur  Cantonment,   gave   a   vent   to   the   rage   of  Indian soldiers. The British punished him by  hanging   to   death.   This   escalated   the   fury  among   Indian   soldiers.   Soon   after   this  incidence   the   Indian   soldiers   in   Lucknow  Cantonment revolted, followed by the revolt  of   cavalry   units   in   Merath.   In   the   chaotic  situation created by the sudden revolt, Indian  soldiers   broke   into   rampage   killing   British  individuals   and   taking   revenge   on   their  families,   at   times   turning   it   into   blind  massacre, putting houses on fire and so on.  Some soldiers began to march towards Delhi.  On 12 th   May 1857 Delhi was captured  and   was   completely   under   the   control   of  Indian soldiers. They handed over the reins  I N D I A N   O C E A N

45  Nanasaheb Peshwa  Bihar,   the   soldiers   at   Dinapur,   near   Patna  revolted   under   the   leadership   of   Kunwar  Singh who was a landlord from west Bihar.  Kunwar Singh also received a good response  from   places   like   Hazaribagh   (prensently   in  Jharkhand)   and   Deogarh,   Sambalpur   in  Odisha.  Nanasaheb Peshwa  led   the   uprising   from  Kanpur.   General  Havelock   went   to  Kanpur to suppress the  uprising.   Nanasaheb  Peshwa   and   Tatya  Tope   made   an  unsuccessful attempt of  keeping   their   hold   on  Kanpur.   Sir   Colin   Campbell,   the   British  Commander-in-Chief,   defeated   Tatya   Tope  and regained the control over Kanpur.  In   this   war   Tatya  Tope   and   Begum   Hazrat  Mahal   were   initially   on  the   winning   side.   The  British   army   under   the  leadership   of   Havelock  and Outram was not very  successful   to   begin   with.  Then   the   King   of   Nepal  Jang Bahdur, arrived with  his   Gurakha   platoons   to  help the British. Maulavi Ahmadulla led the  army of Indian soldiers. Colin Campbell with  his military skills and experience conquered  Lucknow.  Governor General Lord Canning ordered  Colonel Neil to march to Banaras (Varanasi)  and Allahabad. The revolting soldiers had a  great   backing   in   these   cities.   Colonel   Neil  used canons to answer the rifles of   Indian  soldiers. His tactics took a cruel turn when  he   ruthlessly   massacred   and   hanged   many  people. Hearing the news from Varanasi, the  soldiers   in   Allahabad   reacted   by   taking  revenge on the Europeans in the city. Many  Europeans   were   killed   there.   When   Colon  of the uprising to the  Mughal   Emperor  Bahadur   Shah.   He  was   reinstated   as   the  ruling   emperor   of  India, declaring him to  be   ‘Shahanshah-i-  Hindostan’.   However,  he   was   the   nominal  leader of the uprising.  Its   de-facto   leaders  were Nanasaheb Peshwa, Tatya Tope, Rani  Lakshmibai,   Maulavi   Ahmadulla,   Begum  Hazrat   Mahal,   Kunwar   Singh   and   Senani  Bakht Khan. The uprising was more intense  in Delhi, Kanpur, Lucknow, Jhansi and some  parts   of West   Bihar.   Bakht   Khan   took   the  responsibility of assuring the safety of Delhi.  On   27 th   May   1857   the   British   army  attacked Delhi with an intention of recapturing  Delhi.   They   staked   their   entire   strength   on  this   purpose.   Brigadier   John   Nicolas   was  killed   in   the   battle.   Ultimately,   the   British  could   conquer   Delhi   because   of   Sir   John  Lawrence,   a   British   diplomat   and   the   Sikh  platoon. British General Hudson was the one  who   arrested   Bahadur   Shah.   After   arrest,  Bahadur Shah was sent to Rangoon (Burma   /  Myanmar). He died there in 1862.  Prior to the capture of Delhi, the feeling  of dissatisfaction had spread in many places  and   the   riot   was   quickly   intensified   in  Ayodhya,   Lucknow   and   the   Northwestern  province. Very soon it spread like a wild fire  in Aligarh, Itawa, Mathura, Bareli, Azamgadh,  Faizabad, Kanpur, Jhansi, and Ahmadabad.  The   Indian   soldiers   at   Jalandhar,  Ludhiyana, Multan, Sialkot in Punjab actively  responded to the uprising. Similar instances  took   place   in   places   like   Gwalior,   Indore,  Mhow and   Sagar in Madhya Pradesh. The  uprising reached Nasirabad Cantonment and  rest of Rajasthan.  The   uprising   also   reached   Dhaka,  Chittagong   and   Madariganj,   presently   in  Bangladesh   and   Bhagalpur   in   Bihar.   In  Tatya Tope  Bahadur Shah

46  Neil   came   to   know   this,   he   straightaway  proceeded to Allahabad and indiscriminately  killed   the   Indians.   The   British   atrocities  reached its climax.  Try to do this:  Vishnubhat Godse from Vasai was in  Jhansi   in   1857.   Get   the   book,   ‘Maza  Pravas’ authored by him as the eyewitness  of the happenings and read it.  In Jhansi the Indian soldiers rose against  the   British.   They   got   organised   under   the  leadership of Nanasaheb Peshwa, Tatya tope  and Lakshmibai, the Queen of Jhansi. Field  Marshall   Sir   Hugh   Rose   put   Jhansi   under  siege.   Tatya   Tope   came   to   the   queen’s  rescue   but   he   was  defeated   by   Hugh  Rose. The British also  conquered   Kalpi.  Lakshmibai, the queen  died in the battlefield.  Sardar   Mansingh   of  Gwalior   handed   over  Tatya   Tope   to   the  British   by   treachery.  Tatya   Tope   was  hanged to death in 1859. Nanasaheb Peshwa,  wife   of   Bajirao   Peshwa   II   and   nephew  Raosaheb escaped to Nepal and settled there  permanently.  In   Maharashtra   Rango   Bapuji   Gupte  attempted to organise a rebellion at Satara  but he was unsuccessful. His associates were  punished for it. Babasaheb Bhave, the ruler  of the Nargund state joined the uprising in  1858.  The British government got a whiff of  the plan of revolt in Mumbai. Immediately  the people, who were involved in the plan  were   blown   to   death   by   tying   them   to   a  cannon. The Bhils in Khandesh also joined  in the revolt. Their leaders Bheema Naik and  Kajarsingh Naik seized a government treasury  worth seven lakhs. The Bhils and the British  confronted each other at Ambapani (Jalgaon  District).  At   Kolhapur,   Ramji   Shirsat,   who   was  awaiting   the   news   of   the   uprising   in   the  north, took charge of the government treasury  and began to organise the soldiers and others  under   his   leadership.   In   response   to   the  uprising, Chimasaheb, a member of the royal  house   of   Kolhapur,   also   joined   and   took  over the leadership of the rebels. The uprising  was supported well by the people in Kolhapur,  Belgaon and Dharwad.  The nationwide rage created by the war  of 1857 could not be quelled in short time.  It   continued   for   more   than   a   year.   The  number of soldiers, involved in the war at  Delhi,   Merath,   Kanpur,   Lucknow,   Gwalior  and   some   other   places   was   considerably  large, around one lakh. They were adequately  armed. They possessed right state of mind,  also not lacking in valour and yet they were  defeated.  Queen Victoria of England acknowledged  the rage of Indian people, which gave rise  to the war of 1857. To establish peace, she  addressed the issue by publishing a charter,  known   as   the   ‘Queen’s   Proclamation’.   She  declared   that   all   Indians   were   her   subjects  and she wanted to assure them of few things.  Her   assurance   included   a   promise   of   no  discrimination   on   the   basis   of   race,   creed  (faith   system),   caste   and   birth   place,  employment on the basis of qualification and  skills,   no   interference   in   religious   matters,  fulfillment of the agreements with the rulers  of princely states, etc.  The war of 1857 also left a deep impact  on   the   Indian   society.   Provincial   and  communal loyalties were gradually replaced  by a feeling of being united as a nation and  national   loyalty.   It   was   dawned   on   Indian  people   that   they   cannot   win   in   an   armed  combat with the British and a need was felt  to find more innovative methods to counter  the British rule.  Becoming aware of the power of united  Indian   people   during   the   1857   war,   the  British adopted a policy of ‘divide and rule’  Queen Lakshmibai

47  in later years of their regime.  6.3 Background of Founding the Indian  National Congress  The founding of Indian National Congress  that   eventually   followed   the   1857  Independence war, was the key event in the  independence movement of India. It was the  first organisation in India that pulled people  from all quarters of India.  Dwarkanath   Tagore   established   ‘Land  Holders   Association’   in   1837   to   safeguard  the interests of landlords. In 1839, William  Adams, a friend of Raja Ram Mohan Roy  established ‘British India Society’ in London  to   acquaint   the   British   citizens   in   England  with   the   conditions   in   British   India.   Later,  George Thompson,   a   friend   of   Dwarkanath  Tagore   established   ‘Bengal   British   India  Society’.   In   1851,   ‘The   Land   Holder’s  Association’   and   the   ‘Bengal   British   India  Society’ merged together and ‘British Indian  Association’ was   founded.   By   the   initiative  of Harishchandra Mukherjee, this organisation  dispatched a document presenting grievances  of the Indian people to the British Parliament.  At   about   the   same   time,   ‘Madras   Native  Association’ also began to work on similar  lines.   In   1866,   Dadabhai   Nowrojee   in  collaboration with Vyomeshchandra Banerjee  established ‘East India Association’ in London  and   began   the   work   of   creating   awareness  about Indian conditions. The ‘India League’  was active in this regard from 1875. Later,  Surendranath   Banerjee   established   ‘Indian  Association’ and declared that this association  would   work   for   uniting   Indians   of   various  racial   origin   and   caste,   with   the   help   of  common   political   interests   and   aspirations.  Indian Association called a conference of the  representatives   of   various   Indian   provinces,  in 1883 at Kolkata.  The   ‘Madras   Mahajan   Sabha’ founded  in   1884   was   an   important   nationalist  organisation. At about the same time English  education and urge for social reforms resulted  in   the   formation   of   ‘Bombay   Presidency  Association’   in   January   1885   by   Justice  Kashinath   Trimbak   Telang,   Pherozeshah  Mehta and their associates.  6.4   Founding   of   the   Indian   National  Congress  On 28 th   December 1885 the first session  of   Indian   National   Congress   was   held   at  Mumbai,   in   ‘Gokuldas   Tejapal   Sanskrit  College’.   It   was   attended   by   72   delegates  from various parts of India. Vyomeshchandra  Banerjee   presided   over   this   session.   Many  eminent   people   like   Pherozeshah   Mehta,  Dadabhai   Nowrojee,   Rahimtulla   Sayani,  Kashinath   Trimbak   Telang,   Gopal   Krishna  Gokhale   participated   in   the   proceedings   of  this session. Allan Octavian Hume, a British  officer in India took significant lead in the  founding of Indian National Congress. In this  first   session   nine   resolutions   were   passed.  Through   these   resolutions,   demands   for  appointing a commission to enquire into the  British   administration   in   India,   to   appoint  elected   representatives   of   people   on   central  and   provincial   legislative   assemblies,   to  employ Indians in the administrative services,  to conduct civil service examinations in India,  to curtail military expenses, to sanction more  funds   for   higher   education   and   to   make  provisions   for   technological   education   were  put forth.  6.5 ‘Moderates’ and ‘Extremists’  At   about   the   same   time,   a   debate  emerged, especially in Maharashtra, arguing  about   the   priority   of   political   reforms   over  priority   of   social   reforms.   The   ‘Extremists’  wing   of   thinkers   insisted   that   independence  should be the natural priority. An independent  nation could provide a right set-up for social  reformation. On the other hand, the Moderates  thought   that   without   social   reformation  independence was incomplete. They did not  mind appealing to the British government to  help in the task of social reforms.  Gopal Ganesh Agarkar was at the helm  of those who insisted on the priority of social  reforms. He used to say that we need to first

=== Page 58 ===

48  reform ourselves. On the contrary, Lokmanya  Tilak, who was the leader of the Extremists,  used   to   say   that   the   home   taken   over   by  others should be recovered first, then only we  can reform it.  Pherozeshah   Mehta,   Gopal   Krishna  Gokhale were the leaders of the Moderates.  They   felt   that   if   they   could   convince   the  government   about   their   grievances,   with  necessary   proofs,   the   government   will   not  disappoint   them.   Lokmanya   Tilak,   on   the  contrary, felt that British government will not  yield to applications, requests and speeches.  The differences between Moderates and  Extremists reached its climax in the session  of Indian National Congress held at Surat in  1907.   The   Moderates   wanted   to   avoid   the  resolutions of ‘Swadeshi’ and ‘Boycott’. The  Extremist   wanted   to   stop   these   attempts   of  Lokmanya Tilak  Do you know   ?  Section 124(A) And Maharashtra :  On 25 th   November 1870, James Stephen  added   section   124(A)   to   Indian   Penal  Code. It is known as ‘Sedition Law’. This  law   declared   that,   any   act   leading   to  insurgency,   such   as   using   provocative  words,   writing,   signs   or   similar   things  against   the   British   rule   was   a   crime,  punishable   with   fine   or   imprisonment   or  death   sentence.   ‘Bangvasi’   a   weekly  magazine was the first one to be charged  for treason and tried under this law.  On   15th   June   1897   ‘Kesari’   the  newspaper from Pune, published a Poem,  entitled,   ‘Shivajiche   Udgar’.   This   poem  was   supplemented   by   Lokmanya   Tilak  with his subsequent editorials. It included  the   editorials   that   appeared   with   titles  like,   ‘To   Rule,   Not   to   Take   Revenge’  ( ‘ राज्य करणे म्हणजे सूड उगवणे नव ्हे   ’ ), and ‘What  is   Treason?’   ( ‘राजद्रो ्ह   कशाला   म्हणतात?’   ) .  Lokmanya   Tilak   was   the   first   editor   in  India to be arrested for treason and tried  the   Moderates.   This  increased   the   tension  during   the   session.  Reconciliation   became  impossible.   Ultimately  the   Indian   National  Congress   split   into   two  groups.  In   order   to   control  the programmes of Indian  National Congress, Lord Curzon planned the  partition   of   Bengal.   After   the   partition   of  Bengal, the British government began to take  strict   actions   against   the   leaders   of   the  Extremists.   Lokamanya   Tilak   was   sent   to  Mandalay prison for 6 years under the charge  of treason. Bipinchandra Pal was imprisoned  and Lala Lajapatrai was deported.  under Section 124(A).  On 14 th   March 1878   the ‘Vernacular  Press Act’ was implemented. This act was  concerned with writing and printing articles  that would lead to insurgence against the  British   government   or   creation   of   hatred  among people on the basis of race, caste  and creed. A conference was called against  this law by native journalists in Kolkata.  However,   those   who   organised   this  conference   were   from   Maharashtra   -  Ganesh   Vasudev   Joshi   also   known   as  ‘Sarvajanik   Kaka’   and   Justice   Mahadeo  Govind Ranade.  By implementing this law, the British  government   had   confiscated   210   Marathi  books.   Lokmanya   Tilak,   Shivrampant  Paranjape and Ganesh Damodar Savarkar  were put under trial for sedition. ‘1857 -  The First War of Independence’, the book  written   by   Swatantryaveer   Savarkar   was  one of the confiscated books.

49  the plague epidemic in Pune were atrocious.  Enraged   by   it,   Damodar   and   Balkrishna  Chapekar, the two brothers killed Rand.  In 1899, with the initiative of Ganesh  Damodar Savarkar and his brother Vinayak  Damodar Savarkar, ‘Mitra Mela’ a secret  organisation was established at Nasik. The  same organisation was renamed in 1904 as  ‘Abhinav Bharat’. The same year Vinayak  Damodar   Savarkar   went   to   England   for  higher education. From there he began to  send revolutionary literature, pistols, etc. to  the members of Abhinav Bharat. He wrote  a biography of Joseph Mazini, an Italian  revolutionary.   He   also  wrote   the   book,   ‘1857   -  The   First   War   of  Independence’. The British  government came to know  of   the   activities   of  ‘Abhinav Bharat’. Ganesh  Damodar   Savarkar   was  arrested   by   the   British  Government. Jackson, the  British   collector   punished   him   with   life  sentence.   Anant   Lakshman   Kanhere   a  young   Indian   revolutionary   killed   Jackson  to avenge the punishment given to Ganesh  Damodar   Savarkar.   The   government   held  Vinayak   Damodar   Savarkar   for   Jackson’s  murder. He was arrested and had to face  a trial in the court. He was declared guilty  and sentenced to rigorous inprisonment for  50 years at Andaman.  A revolutionary organisation named as  ‘Anusheelan Samiti’ was active in Bengal.  Aurobindo Ghosh and his brother Barindra  Kumar   Ghosh   were   at   the   head   of   this  orgnisation. The organisation had a centre  of bomb making at Maniktala near Kolkata.  In   1908,   Khudiram   Bose   and   Prafulla  Chaki of Anusheelan Samiti, made a plan  of   Kingsford's   assasination   who   was   an  evil British magistrate. However, the horse  cart which was bombed by them did not  Swatantryaveer  Savarkar  Do you know   ?  Lokmanya Tilak had returned from  Mandalay   when   the   First   World   War  had   begun.   Lokmanya Tilak   proposed  that Indians should take advantage of  the   situation   resulted   because   of   the  war.   The   war   had   put   the   British  government   in   a   difficult   situation.  Hence, it was the right time for pressing  the cause of Indian independence. The  Governor of Bombay (Mumbai) called  a meeting of Indian leaders for help.  Lokmanya Tilak, in very clear terms,  told the British that the Indian soldiers  would be sent to fight, if only, British  Government promise the ‘Swaraj’. This  policy of Lokmanya Tilak is known as  ‘Responsive   Co-operation’.   When   the  Governor stopped, Lokmanya Tilak got  up   and   immediately   left   the   meeting  without   bothering   for   anything   or  anybody.  Lokmanya Tilak returned to India after  completing a six year term in the prison of  Mandalay in 1914.   After that there was a  reconciliation   between   Moderates   and  Extremists   and   they   came   together   in   the  Congress session at Lucknow.  6.6 Armed Revolutionaries in India  The   Indian   movement   against   the  British imperialism took many forms. One  of the movements was of armed revolution.  The   main   objective   of   the   armed  revolutionaries was to weaken government  administration,   to   dispel   the   fear   of   the  government in people’s mind and thus to  uproot the British rule from India.  Ram Singh Kuka had planned a revolt  in Punjab against the British government.  In Maharashtra, Vasudev Balwant Phadke,  was the one to do the same.

This was the time when some young  people in India established the ‘Communist  Party’ following the revolutionary thoughts  of Karl Marx. Their aim was to uproot the  colonial   British   rule   and   to   establish   the  rule of working class people (proletariat).  Members   of   the   Communist   Party   were  tried under the charge of attempting armed  revolution.   The   Merath   case   and   Kanpur  case   in   this   context   received   a   lot   of  publicity. Comrade Shripad Amrut Dange,  Muzaffar   Ahmed,   Keshav   Neelkanth  Jogalekar were among the accused in these  cases.  The   young   revolutionaries  Chandrashekhar   Azad,   Bhagat   Singh,  Rajguru and Sukhdev had a secular way  of   thinking.   In   1928,   they   established  ‘Hindustan Socialist Republican Association’  in Delhi. Their goal was to free India from  the British exploitation. They wanted to rip  off   the   British   system   that   exploited   the  farmers   and   labourers.   Their   organisation  had   an   independent   department   called  ‘Hindustan Socialist Republican Army’ for  collecting arms and to execute their plans.  Chandrashekhar Azad was the chief of that  department.  The members of this organisation had  completed   several   adventurous   tasks.  Bhagatsingh and Rajguru avenged the death  of Lala Lajapat Ray. Saunders was killed  to   teach   a   lesson   British   officers.   The  British Government had submitted two bills  in the Central Legislative Assembly, which  were   absolutely   damaging   to   civil   rights.  Bhagat   Singh   and   Batukeshwar   Datta,  exploded   a   bomb   in   the   Legislative  Assembly and surrendered to police. Bhagat  Singh,   Rajguru,   Sukhdev   were   hanged   at  Lahore in 1931 under the charge of treason.  Chandrashekhar   Azad   became   a   martyr,  carry   Kingsford   but   two   British   women  instead.   They   both   died.   Prafulla   Chaki  shot   himself   and   Khudiram   Bose   was  arrested and hanged.  Shyamji   Krishna  Verma   had   founded  ‘India House’ in London.  This organisation used to  give   scholarships   to  Indian   students   in  England   taking   higher  education. Madam Cama  belonged   to   the   group  formed   by   Shyamji   Krishna   Verma.   She  was a socialist and a revolutionary. In the  ‘World   Socialist   Conference’   in   Germany  she raised the issue of  India’s   independence.  She   unfurled   a   flag  representing   India.  Madanlal Dhingra shot  Curzon Wyllie to death  and   was   arrested   and  hanged for it.  Indians in America  and   Canada   had  established   a   revolutionary   orgnisation,  which   was   named   as   ‘Gadar’.   Lala  Hardayal, Bhai Paramanand, Dr. Pandurang  Sadashiv Khankhoje were among the main  leaders of this organisation. Gadar means  uprising.   ‘Gadar’   was   the   name   of   the  newspaper   as   well,   published   by   this  organisation.   This   newspaper   gave   the  message   of   patriotism   and   revolution   to  Indians.   Hutatma   Vishnu   Ganesh   Pingale  contributed in a great way in this work.  Ramprasad Bismil, Ashfaqulla, Roshan  Singh,   Rajendra   Lahiri   of   ‘Hindustan  Republic Association’ had masterminded a  plan   for   raising   money   for   revolutionary  work, which came to be known as ‘Kakori  conspiracy’.   They   sacked   a   train   which  was carrying the government treasury, when  it had stopped at Kakori station in Uttar

He became the leader of  India’s Independence Movement. Under his  leadership   the   independence   movement  expanded considerably.  Gandhiji’s work began in South Africa.  The   British   regime   in   South   Africa   had  reduced the natives and the Indians there  to   a   very   insignificant   status.   Several  discriminatory   laws   and   regulations   were  imposed on them. Gandhiji stood up against  those   laws   and   regulations.   He   was  successful in it with non-violent means. In  1915 Gandhiji returned to India.  In 1917, he took up the issues of the  farmers   in   Chaparanya   in   Bihar.   The  British   plant   owners  there   were   pressing  local   farmers   to  cultivate only indigo.  Not   only   that,   they  used   to   buy   indigo  from   them   at   very  low   rates.   Gandhiji  decided   to   protest  against this exploitation and to relieve the  farmers   from   their   misery   by   doing  Satyagraha. Gandhiji was successful in his  efforts and the British government banned  compulsion   of   cultivating   indigo.   The  farmers were relieved from the harassment  of the British plant owners.  The   British   government   formed   a  committee to suppress the national movement  that   was   spreading   rapidly.   Sir   Sydney  Rowlatt, the British officer was the president  of   the   committee. An Act   was   passed   in  1919 by this committee which came to be  known   as   the   Rowlatt   Act.   This   act  authorised   the   British   government   to  imprison   any   Indian   without   warrant   and  to put under trial without inquiry. Mahatma  Gandhi decided to protest against this act  through   satyagraha.   He   appealed   on   6 th  April 1919 to all people to go for a mass  Bhagat Singh   Rajguru   Sukhdev  Mahatma Gandhi  Surya   Sen   was   the   leader   of   the  revolutionary group working with Hindustan  Socialist Republican Army, in Chittagong,  in Bengal. He prepared a plan to attack on  the British armouries. They carried out the  plan.   While   they   were   nearing   success,  unfortunately, Surya Sen and some of his  colleagues   were   captured   by   the   police.  Along with Surya Sen and his colleagues  sacrificed their lives for the cause of nation.  Kalpana Dutt, one of this group, got a life  sentence. Preetilata Waddedar escaped the  police, but sacrificed her own life. Shanti  Ghosh   and   Suniti   Chaudhury,   the   two  school going girls shot Charles Buckland,  the   British   magistrate.   They   were   caught  and   sentenced   to   imprisonment   for   life.  Beena Das, a member of Indian National  Congress, attempted to kill Stanley Jackson,  the Governor of Bengal, by shooting at him  during   the   convocation   ceremony   of   the  University of Calcutta (Kolkata). She was  caught and sentenced to nine year’s rigorous  imprisonment.  The   revolutionaries   have   contributed  significantly to the Independence Movement  in   India.   They   were   courage   and  determination personified. Their loyalty to  nation and readiness to sacrifice their lives  are unmatched. Their sacrifice has been a  source of inspiration to all.  6.7   Mahatma   Gandhi:   Non-Violent  Resistance Movement  The mantle of Lokmanya Tilak, after

Thousands   of  people   had   gathered   for  the   meeting   held   at  Jalianwala   Bagh   in  Amritsar   for   celebrating  the   festival.   Many   of  them were not aware of  the   ban   put   by   the  government   on   public  gatherings.   General   Dyer   opened   fire   on  these   people   without   any   prior   warning.  About four hundred innocent people were  killed and thousands of them were injured  in this incident. It is known as ‘Jalianwala  Bagh Massacre’.   It created a wave of rage  all   through   India.   Ravindranath   Tagore  criticised this act in very severe terms and  gave up his title (Sir).  The gory scenario in Jalianwala Bagh  Massacre   has   been   described   by   the  celebrated Marathi poet, Kusumagraj (V.V.  Shirwadkar) in his poem entitled ‘Jalianwala  Bagh’. He says:  रक्ताचे नच ओघळ सुकले अजुन   न  क्रु   स   ता वरचे  नव रले न ता   ध व न न   तुझ्   ता  प् े   न ित ता , अजुन न   शब्   ता ांचे  म ां गल तव गीत ताां च ता   होतो म ां   न्   र ता त घो ि   -  ‘‘प् े   म, श ताांनत   अन् क्ष   म   ता  ्   ताां   मध् े   वसतो परमेश   !’’  आ न ि आज हे तुझ्   ता   पत ता क ता   ज्   ता ांच्   ता   ह ता त ताां त  न न ःशस्त   ता ांच्   ता   रक्ताम   ताां स ता मध् े   न ता हत ता त  म ्ता ां   च्   ता   ब ां् ु   क ता   उड ता ल्   ता   मुल ताां ब ता्   क ताां त  जगजेत्   ता ांच्   ता   पर ताक्   म ता ची स्फू   नत तिप ्   रीत   !  प ता चोळ्   ता पर र   पडली प ता हुन प् े   त ताां ची र ता स  न ्   न झ ता कले अस नश ल  ् े   व ता , तू अपुले ख ता स;  असेल ही व ता   सैत ता न ता ची  प्   भूवरी म ता त  एक जखम अन्   नवीन  ् े   शू, तुझ्   ता   क ता ळज ता त   !  In   1920,   in   the   session   of   Indian  National   Congress   held   at   Nagpur,   a  resolution was passed to start the ‘Non Co-  operation   Movement’   all   over   India.  Mahatma   Gandhi   was   asked   to   lead   the  movement.   It   was   decided   to   boycott   all  schools, colleges, legislative bodies, courts,  government offices and imported goods.  Indian   people   responded   to   the   Non  Co-operation   movement   and   boycott   in   a  commendable way. Students participated in  it   on   a   large   scale.   Several   highly  acknowledged Indian lawyers stopped their  practice and participated in the movement.  Among them were Chittaranjan Das, Motilal  Nehru,   M.R.   Jaikar,   Saifuddin   Kichalu,  Vallabhbhai Patel and Rajgopalachari.   At  many places imported clothes were publicly  burnt.   The   farmers   gave   tremendous  response   to   Mahatma   Gandhi’s   appeal   of  non   co-operation. The   working   class   also  participated in the movement on very large  scale. A nationwide series of public strikes  was started. There were 396 instances of  public strikes during the year 1921 alone.  The   leaders   of   Indian   National   Congress  had   organised   these   strikes   at   several  places.   ‘Charkha’   (the   Indian   spinning  wheel)   became   the   symbol   of   ‘Swarajya’  and ‘Swadeshi’ became a household term  in India.  The   British   government   had   levied  heavy tax on salt, an essential commodity  in   daily   life.   Mahatma   Gandhi   declared  satyagraha to protest against this tax. On  the day of 12 th   March 1930, he began a  march from his Sabarmati Ashram to Dandi  on Gujarat seacoast, against this unjust tax.  On 6 th   April on the seacoast at Dandi, he  broke the British law of salt with a token  act   of   collecting   a   handful   of   salt   from  there.  6.8 Azad Hind Sena  In the year 1939, Hitler pushed Europe  in World War   II. The   British   government  without the consent of its Indian subjects  decided   to   involve   India   as   one   of   the  participant countries in the war. Mahatma

53  Gandhi and the Indian  National Congress were  against this decision of  the British Government.  In   this   war   Japan  decided   to   fight   as  Germany’s   allied  nation. Japan conquered  the   regions   under  British rule in Southeast  Asia. Many Indian soldiers in the British  army were taken captive by the Japanese  army.   Rasbihari   Bose   built   ‘Azad   Hind  Sena’   by   recruiting   these   Indian   soldiers  and   later   it   was   reorganised   under   the  leadership   of   Subhash   Chandra   Bose.   In  1943,   Subhash   Chadra   Bose   established  ‘Azad   Hind   Sarkar’ in   Singapore. At   the  end   of   1943   he   had   already   conquered  Andaman and Nicobar. “Tum Muze Khoon  Do!   Main   Tumhe   Azadi   Dunga!”   (“Give  me   your   blood!   I   shall   give   you  independendce!”) This speech by him turned  into a key slogan among Indians. In 1944,  he had conquered the Arakan province and  the British outposts on the east border of  Assam.   The   soldiers   of Azad   Hind   Sena  kept   fighting   in   very   adverse   conditions.  They could not reach and capture Imphal.  6.9 ‘Quit India’ Movement of 1942  The   executive   council   of   the   Indian  National   Congress   passed   a   resolution   at  Wardha that the British should quit India.  This   resolution   was   to  receive   final   approval   in  the   session   at   Mumbai.  On   7 th   August   1942   the  session of Indian National  Congress   began   on   the  Gowalia Tank Ground in  Mumbai.   Maulana   Abul  Kalam   Azad   was   the  President of this session.  On   8 th   August,   in   this   session   Pandit  Jawaharlal   Nehru   presented   the   resolution  of ‘Quit India’ and it was approved with  great   majority.   It   was   demanded   that   the  British should immediately leave India. In  this   session   it   was   also   decided   that   the  ‘Quit   India’ movement   should   be   taken  forward with a non-violent apporoch under  Mahatma   Gandhiji’s  leadership.   Mahatma  Gandhi   appealed   to  all   Indians   saying,  “This   movement   is  not   of   the   Indian  National   Congress,  but   of   all   Indians.  Every   Indian   man  and   woman   should  know   in   their   mind  that they are free citizens from this very  moment and they should prepare themselves  to fight”. While emphasising that this was  going to be a very rigorous fight Mahatma  Gandhi said, “Today I am going to give  you the mantra,   ‘Do or Die’. This should  be the oath to which we commit ourselves.  Prepare   to   sacrifice   yourselves   for   this  oath.’’   Gandhiji’s   words   created   a   new  spirit among Indians.  The British government tried to crush  the ‘Quit India’ movement before it started.  Before   the   day   of   9th   August   could   see  sunlight, all prominent leaders like Gandhiji,  Maulana Azad,   Pandit   Jawaharlal   Nehru,  Vallabhbhai   Patel   were   arrested.   The  government put a ban on public gatherings,  speeches, rallies and protestations. It sealed  all the offices of Indian National Congress,  in   the   country.   The   resistance   put   up   by  all,   aged   and   young   in   the   villages   like  Chimur,   Ashti,   Yawali,   Mahad,   Gargoti,  etc.   with   steadfastness   and   courage   will  indeed be remembered for ever.  By   the   end   of   1942   this   movement  supported   by   common   people   took   a  different turn. Its leadership was assumed  by the young socialist leaders.

54  Krantisinha  Nana Patil  Do you know   ?  Echoes   of   India’s   independence  movement in America and Singapore :  America -   During the time of World  War II, ‘Life’, the weekly published in  America demanded that India should be  given   independence   immediately.  Renowned   Americans   from   various  fields like Albert Einstein, Louis Fisher,  Edger   Snow,   Wendell   Willkie,   John  Gunther, Pearl Buck, etc. had signed this  petition.  Singapore (Shonan) -   Thousands of  Indians in Singapore marched in a rally  with   placards   saying,   “India’s  independence without delay!”, “India for  Indians”.  Under the leadership of the ‘Indian  Independence   League’   anti-British  protestations were held in all big cities  of Malaya (Malaysia). There were such  protestations   in   Medan   and   Sumatra  (Indonesia).  Narayan,   Dr.   Ram   Manohar   Lohia,  Achyutrao   Patwardhan,   Aruna   Asaf   Ali,  S.M. Joshi, N.G. Gore were on the forefront  among them.  In order to mislead the British in  the 1942 movement, some of the leaders  had assumed pseudonyms names.  Sucheta Kripalani   - Dadi, Bahanji  Achyutrao Patwardhan   - Kusum  Ram Manohar Lohia   - Doctor  Sadique Ali   - Sushila, Satya  Baba Raghavdas   - Didi  Aruna Asaf Ali   - Kadam  S. M. Joshi   - Imam Ali  British   regime   in   Satara   district   and  established   ‘People’s   Government’.   This  government   took   over   the   administrative  tasks   like   collecting   revenue,   maintaining  law   and   order,   solving   the   court   cases,  punishing criminals.  In   this   period   the   foundation   of   the  British   rule   in   India   became   weak.   The  ‘Quit India’ movement was an expression  of   the   strong   opposition   of   the   Indian  people   to   the   British   rule.   The   British  administrators became aware that it will be  difficult for them to rule the Indians any  longer. The end of the British Empire was  evident   to   them.   The   ‘Rebellion   of   the  Sailors of the British Indian Navy - 1946’  added to the unrest against the British.  Several   revolutionary   groups   were  established in the country at local levels.  The   groups   like   ‘Azad   Dasta’ established  by   Bhai   Kotwal,   in   Karjat   Taluka,   ‘Lal  Sena’   in   Nagpur   established   by   General  Awari   left   no   alternative   for   the   British  government   but   pray   god.   In   Mumbai  Vitthal   Javheri,   Usha   Mehta   and   their  colleagues   started   a   transmission   centre,  named ‘Azad Radio’.  In 1942, in some parts of India, people  were   sucessful   in  uprooting   the   British  Governance.   In  Midnapur   District  (Bengal),   Balia   (U.P.)  and Bhagalpur, Purnia  (Bihar) near Azamgarh  the   British   officers  were   forced   to   leave  their   offices.   People  took   charge   of   the  governance   at   these   places.   Krantisinha  Nana   Patil,   a   revolutionist   established  Pratisarkar   (parallel   government)   in   the  Satara district of Maharashtra. He, with the  help   of   his   associates   put   an   end   to   the

55  Oral Sources of History  Bengal was struck with a famine  after   1942.   During   the   period   of  famine,   the   revolutionaries   in   Bengal  announced a national government. The  leaders of this government laid down  an ideal for people. Ajay Mukherjee.  (Who   became   the   chief   minister   of  West   Bengal   in   post-independence  India.)   was   interviewed   by   Shripad  Kelkar, the author of the book, ‘Chhodo  Bharat’.   This   interview   provides   us  with   some   ideas   of   how   a   national  leader should lead his life, how severe  a famine can be and how oral sources  are important for understanding history.  The following statement made by  Ajay Mukherjee is very important. He  said, “During the famine we survived  only   on   3   chhatak   rice   (meaning  cooked rice less than 1/4th of seer*)  and very little dal for the whole day.”  *1 seer = 0.933105 kilogram  16 chhatak = 1 seer  04 chhatak = 1/4th seer  Thus,   3   chhatak   is   less   than   ¼  seer.  Thus,   when   the   possibility   of   India  becoming a free nation had become evident,  Muhammad Ali Jinnah and his party, the  ‘Muslim   League ’   began   to   insist   on   a  separate   nation   for   the   Muslims.   There  were many communal riots in many parts  of   the   country.   It   finally   resulted   in   the  partition   of   the   country.   In   the   month   of  August of 1947, ‘India’ and ‘Pakistan’ two  separate nations came into existence.  Try to do this  Collect information and pictures about  revolutionaries and freedom fighters from  your area and make a presentation.  History tells us that it was India, the  nation   that   created   an   example   for   the  world   of   fighting   successfully   against   the  colonial rule. It gave inspiration to many  countries   who   were   suffering   under   the  shackles of colonial rule.  The Constitution of independent India  came into implementation on 26 th   January  1950.

57  ‘Decolonisation’   is   the   process   of  ending the colonial rule and handing over  the   political   and   administrative   power   to  local people by the colonialists. Opposition  to   colonialism,   struggle   for   independence  and the nations under colonisation regaining  their independence are the three stages of  decolonisation   process.   India   became  independent on 15 th   August 1947. However,  at that time there existed several Princely  States   in   India,   which   were   ruled   by   the  hereditary   rulers   under   British   suzerainty.  These   states   were   given   the   choice   to  decide whether to accede to India or not.  If these states had decided against it, then  it   would   have   become   very   difficult   to  create the Indian Union. Sardar Vallabhbhai  Patel, the first Deputy Prime Minister and  the Home Minister of India, pursued most  of the rulers of these states in favour of  acceding to India so that political integration  of India could be possible. In this lesson,  we   are   going   to   take   a   brief   review   of  these events.  7.1   Decolonisation   to   Political  Integration of India  When   India   gained  independence,   there  were   more   than   600  princely states of various  size.   Their   political  integration   was   the  biggest   challenge   faced  by   the   leaders   of  independent India. There  was   political   awakening   in   the   Princely  States   because   of   Non   Co-operation  movement.   Sardar   Vallabhbhai   Patel  handled the situation with great skill and  tact. He took a conciliatory approach and  won the confidence of the rulers of these  states.   With   the   exception   of   Junagadh,  Hyderabad, and Kashmir remaining states  responded   positively   to   the   appeal   and  merged in India. Later, Sardar Vallabhbhai  Patel adopted a stern policy and resolved  the problem of the accession of those states,  who were unwilling to accede.  Junagadh :   It was a princely state in  Saurashtra   (Gujarat).   The   people   of   this  state were ready to accede to India while its  Nawab   wanted   to   merge   in   Pakistan.  However   common   people   opposed   the  Nawab’s decision.   He escaped to Pakistan.  In February 1948, Junagadh merged in India.  Hyderabad   Freedom   Struggle   :  Hyderabad   was   the   largest   amongst   the  princely states in India. It comprised Telugu,  Kannada and Marathi regional sections. It  was ruled by Nizam. He put restrictions on  the civil and political rights of his subjects  to   a   great   extent.   To   fight   against   the  suppressive policies of Nizam people of the  state   established   various   organisations,  namely.   ‘Andhra   Parishad’   in   Telangana,  ‘Maharashtra   Parishad’  in   Marathawada   and  ‘Karnataka   Parishad’   in  Karnataka.   Swami  Ramanand   Tirtha   led  Hyderabad   freedom  struggle skillfully with the  help of loyal workers of  these three organisations.  He founded the ‘Hyderbad  State Congress’ and gave a momentum to  the struggle for Hyderabad’s accession.  7.

58  The ‘Hyderabad State Congress’ passed  a   resolution   in   favour   of   Hyderabad’s  merger in India. It was opposed by Nizam  for   the   fear   of   losing   his   hold.   He   was  willing to join Pakistan. The people were  in favour of India while the ruler was in  favour   of   Pakistan.   Kasim   Razvi,   who  could exercise considerable influence over  Nizam,   founded   an   organisation   called  ‘Razakar’. Kasim Razvi and his organisation  practiced many atrocities against the people  who   were   fighting   for   democracy.   Nizam  was   adamant   on   his   policies.   He   was  averse to any negotiations and closed all  channels   of   mediation.   Ultimately   the  Indian   government   launched   a   police  campaign   against   Nizam.   This   campaign  was   named   as   ‘Operation   Polo’.   On   17 th  September 1948 Nizam finally surrendered  and Hyderabad state was merged in India.  Try to do this.  Try to collect information about the  newspapers published during ‘Hyderabad  Freedom   Struggle ’   with   the   help   of  internet.  The Kashmir Issue :   Hari Singh, the  ruling king of the State of Kashmir, had  decided neither to join India, nor Pakistan  after   India’s   independence.   However,  Pakistan had plans to annex Kashmir to its  territory.   Therefore,   Pakistan   began   to  pressurise King Hari Singh. On 22 nd   October  1947,   armed   bands   of   intruders   attacked  Kashmir   from   the   Pakistan   border.   King  Hari   Singh,   who   wanted   to   maintain  independent   status,   asked   India   for   help.  On   27 th   October   1947,   he   consented   to  merge   Kashmir   in   India   and   officially  submitted   the   Agreement   (Instrument   of  Accession) to the Government of India. The  Indian   Army   was   sent   for   Kashmir’s  protection. It captured a significant portion  of Kashmir’s territory that was acquired by  the armed intruders from Pakistani border,  however, they managed to keep their hold  on some portion. In 1948, India presented  the   Kashmir   issue   in   ‘United   Nations’.  Thus, Kashmir issue became an international  issue. Even the ‘United Nations’ could not  persuade Pakistan to withdraw their troops  from the territory of Kashmir occupied by  them.   However,   then   the   ‘National  Conference Party’ decided on plebiscite to  solve the issue and to accede Kashmir to  India.   The   constitution   of   Jammu   and  Kashmir was drafted and since then Jammu-  Kashmir has been an integral part of the  Republic of India. It was accorded a special  status under ‘Article 370’.  7.2 Dadra and Nagar-Haveli  Dadra and Nagar-Haveli are located in  the interior parts of Gujarat coast. It is on  the northern banks of the river Damanganga.  Do you know   ?  The   Contribution   of  Marathwada   in   ‘Hyderabad  Freedom   Struggle   :   The   following  leaders   were   actively   involved   in  ‘Hyderabad   Freedom   Struggle’   :  Swami   Ramanand Tirth,   Govindbhai  Shroff,   Babasaheb   Paranjape,  Digambarrao Bindu, A. K. Wagmare,  Anantrao Bhalerao, Fulchand Gandhi,  Manikchand   Pahade,   Devisingh  Chauhan,   Ashatai   Waghmare,  Dagadabai   Shelke   and   others.   The  following   people   became   martyrs   :  Vedprakash,   Shyamlal,   Govind  Pansare,   Shridhar   Vartak,   Bahirjee  Shinde,   Janardan   Mama   and   others.  The leaders and people of Marathwada  had   a   lion’s   share   in   ‘Hyderabad  Freedom   Struggle’.   17 th   September,  the   day   of   Hyderabad’s   Freedom   is  celebrated   as   the   ‘Marathwada  Liberation Day’.

59  It   was   part   of   Portuguese   dominion   and  was administered by a Portuguese governor.  It   was   anticipated   that   after   India’s  independence   the   Portuguese   would   hand  over   these   regions   to   India   and   quit.  However they did not do so. Therefore, the  local   people   in   Dadra   and   Nagar-Haveli  rose   against   the   Portuguese.   The  organisations,   namely,   ‘United   Front   of  Goans’,   ‘Azad   Gomantak   Dal’   came  together   and   planned   a   campaign   to   free  these regions from the Portuguese rule. In  1954, Francis Mascarenhas, Vimal Sardesai,  the   leaders   of   ‘Azad   Gomantak   Dal’  intensified   the   struggle.   With   fierce  protestations people captured Nagar-Haveli.  The   other   organisation,   ‘United   Front   of  Goans’ took   hold   of   Dadra.   ‘Rashtravadi  Mukti Sena’, a branch of ‘Azad Gomantak  Dal’ took over Naroli, Pimparia and some  part of Silvasa. Local police stations and  administrative offices were attacked. Public  unrest   reached   such   extent   that   the  Portuguese army had to beat a retreat. The  Portuguese   Captain   Fidalgo   surrendered.  The   Government   of   India   appointed   K.G.  Badalani to bring normalcy in administration  in these area. According to the agreement  with the Indian government, the region of  Dadra   and   Nagar-Haveli   was   merged   in  India   on   2 nd   August   1954.   Vishvanath  Lavande,   Rajabhau   Vakankar,   Sudhir  Phadke,   Nanasaheb   Kajarekar,   Nilubhau  Limaye, Vasant   Zanjale   and   many   others  participated in this struggle. In 1961 Dadra  and Nagar-Haveli were given the status of  ‘Union Territories’.  7.3 Goa  The movement of liberating Goa from  the Portuguese rule had begun during pre-  independence   times   only.   In   1928   ‘Goa  Congress   Committee’   was   founded   in  Mumbai. Dr.   T.   B.   Kunha was the president  of this committee. In 1929, Goa Congress  Committee   became   an   integral   branch   of  Indian National Congress. In 1939, posters  with   ‘Quit   Goa’ slogans   were   posted   all  over   Goa.   Francis   Mascarenhas,   the  President   of   United  Goan Front unfurled the  Indian   flag   in   Goa.   In  1946,   under   the  leadership   of   Dr.   Ram  Manohar   Lohia,   the  movement   of   ‘Civil  Disobedience’   was  launched   in   Goa.  Dr.   Lohia   was   arrested  and was deported from Goa. Dr.T.B.   Kunha,  Purushottam   Kakodkar,   Dr.   Ram   Hegde,  Dr.   P.   P.   Shirodkar   and   Gopal   Mayekar  were   arrested   for   participating   in   the  satyagraha   at   Madgaon.   Dr.   Kunha   was  imprisoned for eight years. He was sent to  a prison in Portugal. Later, after returning  to   India,   he   started   publishing   two  newspapers,   namely,   ‘Azad   Goa’   and  ‘Swatantra Goa’.  After   India’s   independence,   the  movement for liberating Goa took roots in  Maharashtra. In 1954, the ‘Goa Vimochan  Sahayak   Samiti’   was   founded   at   Pune.  Keshavarao Jedhe, N.G. Gore, and Jayantrao  Tilak took on the responsibility of directing  the movement. Some groups who volunteered  for the cause of Goa’s liberation marched  to Goa under the leadership of N.G. Gore  and   Senapati   Bapat.   One   group   of   those  volunteers   unfurled   the   national   flag   of  India on the fort of Panaji.  There were a number of other eminent  people,   who  participated   in   the  Goa   liberation  movement. It included  people   like   Pandit  Mahadevshastri Joshi,  Shirubhau   Limaye,  Peter   Alvaris   and  Sudha   Joshi.   The  Dr.   T.   B.   Kunha  Senapati Bapat

60  contribution   of   Mohan   Ranade   in   this  struggle is very significant. He systematically  began anti-Portuguese propaganda in Goa.  With the help of Azad Gomantak Dal, he  also   started   armed   struggle   against   the  Portuguese. During an attack on a police  station,   he   was   shot   and   got   injured.  Portuguese government kept him in jail till  1972.   Acharya   P.K.   Atre   used   the   daily  newspaper ‘Maratha’, published by him as  a platform for supporting the movement.  The   strong   public   sentiments   in   the  matter   of   Goa’s   liberation   moved   Pandit  Jawaharlal Nehru to act on it. A mission  was   planned   under   the   code   name,  ‘Operation Vijay’.   Indian army descended  in   Goa   to   accomplish   the   mission.   The  army was helped by local civilians as well.  They showed the army the places where,  the Portuguese had planted landmines. The  Portuguese surrendered within 48 hours. On  19 th   December 1961 Goa became a part of  the   Indian   Republic.   The   foreign   rule   of  450 years came to an end.  Try to do this.  Collect   information   of   the   fort   of  Panaji and make a poster about the fort.  7.4 Puducherry  When   India   got   its   independence,  Puducherry was still a French colony. There  prevailed a general notion among Indians  that   departure   of   the   British   from   India  would send a signal the Portuguese and the  French   to   leave   India   on   their   own.  However, it was not to be so. The dispersed  regions   including   Puducherry,   Karaikal,  Mahe and Yanam and also Chandranagar  in West Bengal were ruled by the French.  The French Government was unwilling to  surrender these regions. People at Puducherry  got   united   under   the   leadership   of   V.  Subbayya,   a   communist   politician   and   a  trade unionist. Taking a serious note of the  happenings in Puducherry, the Government  of India strongly demanded that the French  government return the Indian regions held  by them. In June 1948, a bilateral agreement  was signed between both the governments.  Thus,   it   became   possible   to   resolve   the  Puducherry   issue   by   way   of   negotiations,  public movements and governmental actions.  In 1949-50, after a positive public poll,  Chandrnagar   was   merged   in   the   Indian  Republic. Later, on 13 th   October 1954 by a  bilateral   agreement   between   the   Indian  government   and   French   government,   the  minutes of the merger process were drafted.  The vote in the Legislative Assembly and  in   the   Municipal   Corporation   was   in   the  support of accession. On 1 st   November 1954  all French colonies in India were merged  in   India.   In   1962,   the   French   Parliament  approved of the bilateral agreement and in  1963   Puducherry   was   declared   to   be   a  ‘Union Territory’.  Under   the   leadership   of   Pandit  Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Vallabhbhai  Patel,   the   Princely   States   in   India   were  acceded to India and became integral part  of the Indian Republic. Thus, the process  of   political   integration   of   India   was  completed.  In   the   next   lesson   we   are   going   to  review the ‘World Wars’ and its impact on  India.

63  8.   World Wars and India  The first half of the twentieth century  witnessed two World Wars. These were the  most   important   events   of   the   century  witnessed two World Wars. It changed the  world   scenario.   We   are   going   to   learn  about its impact on India.  8.1 First World War (1914-1918 C.E.)  The   First   World   War   began   in   1914  C.E.   The   main   cause   of   it   was   the  competition amongst the European countries,  who nourished imperialistic ambitions.  Causes of the First World War :   We  have already seen that the latter half of the  nineteenth century was marked by several  industrial inventions. Machines came in use  for various production processes. European  countries   were   now   equipped   to   increase  production because of mechanisation. They  needed   more   raw   material   to   match   the  quantitative   increase   in   production   and  more markets to sell their surplus products  as   well.   Imperialistic   European   nations  began to search for newer lands to meet  these needs. This would often create warlike  situations   among   them.   Keeping   this   in  view, more powerful nations in Europe, felt  the   need   to   continuously   increase   their  military power and armoury.  The   countries   like   England,   France,  Russia,   Portugal,   Holland,   Belgium,   etc.  had   already   expanded   their   empires   in  Africa   and   Asia.   In   the   pre-world   war  Europe,   England,   Germany,   Austria-  Hungary, Russia, France and Italy were the  nations   of   primary   importance.   Among  them rival groups were formed. Because of  the rivalry every nation began to enhance  its military and naval strength; there was  a competition to produce more and more  destructive weapons. This ultimately resulted  in political situation akin to war.  Immediate Cause of the First World  War   :   The   Austrian   Prince,   Archduke  Franz   Ferdinand   and   his   wife   were  assassinated in Serbia by a Serbian maniac.  In Austria people believed that this whole  act   was   manoeuvred   by   the   Serbian  Kingdom.   Hence,   Austria   called   a   war  against   Serbia.   Russia   came   in   to   help  Serbia.   Two   distinct   groups   of   European  nations were formed, one group supporting  Austria   and   another   supporting   Serbia.  Austria and Hungary were trying to suppress  Serbia   and   Germany   was   on   their   side.  Belgium had a neutral policy. Even then,  Germany attacked Belgium and established  their   supremacy   there.   England   stood   up  with   Belgium   and   called   a   war   against  Germany. Now Germany, Austria, Turkey,  Bulgaria (known as ‘central powers’) were  on one side and England, France, Russia  (known   as   ‘allied   nations’)   were   on   the  other. Later, Italy joined the allied powers.  In the last stage of the war America joined  in with the allied nations.  A   naval   war   was   fought   in   1916  between Germany and England at Jutland  in   the   North   Sea   and   German   navy   was  defeated.   It   resulted   in   a   peace   treaty   in  1918, known as ‘The   Treaty   of Versailles’.  This peace treaty put an end to the First  World War.  8.1   First World War (1914-1918 C.E.)  8.2   Second   World   War   (1939-1945  C.E.)  8.3   World Wars and India  8.3.1   First World War and India  8.3.2   Second   World   War   and  India  8.4   Impact   of   the   World   Wars   on  India

64  Foundation of ‘League of Nations’ :  All the nations who were involved in the  First World War seriously felt the need to  create some solution to avoid any situation  that   could   lead   to   another   world   war.  Woodrow   Wilson,   the American   President  was   a   peace-loving   and   idealistic   leader.  He emphasised on the need of having an  organisation of the leading nations, finding  peaceful   solutions   for   conflicts   between  nations and establishing peace in the world.  An   organisation   known   as   ‘League   of  Nations’ was established with this objective.  Germany,   Austria   and   other   defeated  nations   were   not   allowed   to   become  members of the league. The concept of the  ‘League   of   Nations’   was   deliberated   by  America   and   yet   it   did   not   become   a  member of the league. As a result England  and France retained their dominance in the  league.  8.2   Second   World   War   (1939-1945  C.E.)  The Second World War proved to be  more destructive than the First World War.  It   was   certainly   more   extensive   than   the  First   World   War   and   its   warfare   was  technologically more advanced.  Causes of the Second World War :  The ‘League of Nations’ intended to avoid  conflicts between nations. The Nazis under  the leadership of Hitler grabbed the power  in   Germany.   Hitler   began   to   escalate  Germany’s military power so as to avenge  the   demeaning   conditions   imposed   on  Germany   by   the   Versailles   treaty.   He  focused   on   increasing   the   strength   of  military as well as navy. Meanwhile, Soviet  Russia, a communist nation was becoming  more   powerful.   It   made   the   nations   like  England,   America   and   France   uneasy.  Soviet   Russia   and   imperialist   Germany  viewed each other as arch enemies. Keeping  this in view, England and France ignored  Germany’s   advances,   thinking   that   it   will  keep   Soviet   Russia’s   increasing   power  under   control.   In   1938,   Hitler   won   the  Sudeten province in Czechoslovakia, which  was   populated   in   majority   by   people   of  German origin. In 1939, he attacked Poland.  Actually   Poland   was   looked   upon   as   a  neutral country by all European nations. In  spite of this, Hitler attacked and conquered  Poland.   Therefore,   England   declared   war  against Germany.  Gradually,   Germany   began   to   grab  lands   of   other   European   countries   in   bits  and pieces.   It had already won Poland at  the   very   beginning   of   the   war.   Denmark  surrendered   to   Germany.   So   did   Norway.  In a short time Germany conquered Holland  and Belgium and its army marched towards  Paris.   Germany   conquered   France   too.   In  May 1940, it attacked England by assaulting  the   British   platoons   present   at   Dunkirk.  England, with great caution moved out two  and half lakh of its soldiers from Dunkirk.  In the world history, this instance of beating  a successful retreat, is of great significance.  During   this   period Winston   Churchill   had  taken over control of England, as the Prime  Minister   after   Neville   Chamberlain’s  resignation from the post.  In   1939,   Hitler   violated   the   ‘Non-  aggression   Pact’,   made   with   Stalin   and  attacked   Soviet   Russia.   While   the   Nazi  army   was   marching   towards   Stalingrad,  Russian   army   was   on   the   retreat.   In   the  month   of   November   1943,   on   reaching  Stalingrad,   three   lakh   soldiers   of   the  unsuspecting Nazi army, were caught in the  trap   set   up   by   the   Soviet   army.   Soviet  Russia   defeated   the   Germans   under   the  leadership   of   Marshal   Georgy   Zhukov.  Armies   of   the   allied   nations   took   over  Berlin.   Hitler   went   in   underground   exile  and committed suicide. Before this happened,  Mussolini was also defeated and died. The  Nazi   soldiers   in   North   Africa   had   also  surrendered.

65  For additional information :  Fascism :   It is a political ideology,  which   does   not   believe   in   democracy,  liberalism,   individual   freedom   and  equality. Fascism derives from the Latin  word   ‘Fasces’.   After   the   First   World  War   was   over,   Benito   Mussolini,   an  Italian   leader   and   later   the   Prime  Minister   of   Italy,   built   a   movement,  which   he   named   as   ‘Fascism’.  Opposition   to   democratic   institutions,  greater focus on action, absolute political  authority,   centralisation   of   political  power,   aggressive   nationalism,  justification of war and violence are the  major characteristics of fascism.  Nazism   :   Nazism   is   in   a   way   a  slightly diverse form of fascism. Nazism  gave   more   importance   to   racism.   The  genocide of European Jews in Germany  by Hitler had its roots in racism. It may  be said that Nazism was an extremely  aggressive and corrupt manifestation of  fascism.  Japan entered in this war, in support  of Germany. In 1941, Japan attacked Pearl  Harbour and destroyed the American naval  base.   This   resulted   in   America   declaring  war against Japan. Thus, the war field of  Second World War expanded further. Later,  Japan   went   on   capturing   the   regions   of  Philippines,   Myanmar,   Malaya   and  Singapore. In addition Japan even marched  up   to   Assam,   Arakan   and   Imphal.   This  drove   the   British   to   act   against   Japan’s  aggression.   When   Japan   seemed   to   have  been   going   ahead   undaunted   with   their  aggressive policies, America launched aerial  attacks   two   Japanese   cities   with   atom  bombs,   first   on   Hiroshima   and   then  Nagasaki.   At   last,   Japan   surrendered   on  15th August 1945. This put an end to the  Second World War.  8.3 World Wars and India  8.3.1   First   World   War   and   India   :  The British Government of India, compelled  India, one of their colonies, to participate  in the world war, without any concern for  willingness or unwillingness of the Indians.  India became the source of procuring help  in the form of money, food, clothing and  other   war   supplies.   During   the   year   of  1919-20   the   British   Government   in   India  provided   help   to   England   worth   Rs.19  billion (1 billion = 100 crores).

Till  the   end   of   1918,   British   government   in  India sent weaponry and ammunition worth  Rs. 1.4 billion.

66  First World War - War Memorial at Pune  World War I left significant impact on  various fields including production of war  supplies,   civil   industries,   trade,   economic  policies,   sea   and   land   transportation,  farming   and   agricultural   production,   fuel  supply,   defence   systems,   etc.   This   war  boosted India’s industrial growth. The direct  and indirect impacts of the war were more  evident   in   fields   like   iron   industry,   steel  industry, coal and mining industries. After  the war was over, there was considerable  growth   in   motor   transportation   and   the  number of motor vehicles. During war times  and post-war period there was decrease in  the   export   amounting   to   a   loss   of   Rs.33  crores,   approximately.   The   prices   of  agricultural products reduced but the prices  of industrial products increased. Indian food  grains were exported to England and allied  nations. It caused a shortage of food grains  for   the   Indians.   Prices   of   food   grains   in  Indian markets began to rise.  The   Indian   involvement   in   the   First  World War had mixed impact on India. As  far as the defence tactics were concerned  the   Indian   soldiers   and   Indian   political  leaders learnt a few things. They realised  because of their experience on the European  war field that the Indian weaponry was far  too   less   sophisticated,   compared   to   other  nations. Some factors made them understand  how India could be considered backward in  the   matters   of   aircrafts,   mechanised   war  instruments and infantry, medical facilities,  modernisation of the armed forces, military  training, adequate storage of war supplies,  etc.   Considering   these   factors   the   British  Government in India formed a committee  to bring in effect the required changes. This  committee   made   a   report   ready  recommending some useful changes in the  Indian military systems.  In 1917, Governor General and Viceroy  Lord   Chelmsford   and   Edwin   Samuel  Montagu,   Secretary   of   State   of   India,  together   prepared   a   report   on   the  administrative reforms needed in the British  administration in India. Accordingly, apart  from civil provisions a few promises were  made with regard to military organisation  in   India.   It   was   promised   that   Indian  soldiers will be posted on various positions  in the army without any concern for their  caste, race and religion. A proper ratio of  Indian   recruits   will   be   maintained   in   the  army.   An   academy   in   India   will   be  established   similar   to   Sandhurst Academy  in England. Ten seats in this academy will  remain reserved for young Indian candidates.  Those   who   were   trained   in   the   military  college at Indore would be given ‘King’s  Commission.’ The Cavalry will be reduced  in its strength. The strength of the provincial  military units would be enhanced. In 1921,  a   new   department   for   military   supplies  called   ‘Goods   and   Supply’   was   opened.  Because of the war, the foundation of the  Indian Air Force was widened. The Indian  naval units proved their grit and bravery in  the war at Persian Gulf.

67  Lokmanya Tilak through his editorials  published   in   the   newspaper   ‘Kesari’   and  through his speeches insisted that the Indian  Navy and India’s significant position in the  world   political   scenario   should   be   duly  acknowledged and there should not be any  discrimination while appointing Indian men  on positions of authority. Lokmanya Tilak  and other Indian leaders showed a positive  approach in helping the British Government  during the First World War. They believed  that the co-operation offered by the Indian  people will be beneficial to them in future.  We   get   to   witness   the   far   sightedness   of  Lokmanya   Tilak   in   his   approach   during  war times.  India was forced into this war started  by   the   British   imperial   rule.   Pandit  Jawaharlal Nehru wrote about it in a letter  written   to   his   daughter,   Indira.   He   said,  ‘‘This was not the war of India. India did  neither have anything against Germany nor  Turkey.   However,   India   did   not   had   any  voice   in   this   regard.   India   was   a   British  colony. It could not but trail its master’’.  India was extremely poor. There was  no dearth of candidates willing to enter the  Army.   About   11   lakh   of   Hindi   soldiers  fought in this war. Hindi soldiers provided  a considerable support to the British army.  Besides, India also contributed one hundred  and   fifty   crores   of   Rupees   to   the   war  expenses.  During the times of war Indian people  began to migrate to Canada and America.  The   government   of   Canada   was   heavily  under   the   influence   of   the   British  Government.   It   rejected   entry   to   Indian  migrants.   It   did   not   allow   ‘Kamagata  Maru’, a steam ship with Indian migrants  aboard   under   the   leadership   of   Baba  Gurudit Singh, to anchor in the Canadian  port   of   Vancouver.   People   on   this   ship  returned. On their return journey, ‘Kamagata  Maru’   reached   the   port   of   ‘Bajbaj’   near  Kolkata. There, the British officers ordered  Indian passengers to return immediately to  their own towns and villages. However, the  Indians   did   not   follow   the   order.   So,   the  British   officers   began   to   shoot   and   30  Indian   passengers   died   in   it. This   cruelty  on   part   of   the   British   officers   created   a  public outcry throughout India.  Congress   and   Defence   Policy   :  Indian National Congress had a definite  approach   about   the   defence   issues   and  right from the beginning they had formed  a   number   of   policies   in   that   regard.   It  included;  •   Indian citizens should be encouraged to  educate themselves by providing them  facilities of education and training with  a view to make them capable for self-  defence and defence of the nation.  •   The   official   expenditure   on   defence  should be curbed, if that is not possible  then other official expenditures should  be reduced.  •   Indian men should be recruited in the  regional units of army.  •   In   compliance   with   the   ‘Queen’s  Proclamation’ Indian people should be  appointed on the posts of higher grades.  •   There should be a defence academy in  India.  •   Home Guards and groups of volunteers  should be established.  •   The   British   Government   should   share  part of the defence expenditure meant  for India’s protection from its treasury.  With   such   demands,   the   Indian  National   Congress   articulated   their  demands   for   defence   in   clear   terms.  However, the British Government adopted  policies,   suitable   only   to   their   self-  interest.

68  First   World   War   and   TISCO   :  There   is   a   close   relationship   between  the First World War and Tata Iron and  Steel Company (TISCO). During World  War I railways was the only option for  the swift movement of the army and the  transportation   of   artillery.   England  required good railway tracks in Europe  as well as for military logistics in the  province   of   Iraq.   This   requirement  proved to be beneficial to TISCO. The  company   took   great   efforts   and  manufactured   around   1500   miles   long  tracks.   Some   of   the   senior   officers   in  England were not sure of the capability  of   the   Indian   company   for   producing  steel   tracks.   But   the   Indians   overcame  it. In 1919, after the conclusion of World  War I, Viceroy Lord Chelmsford visited  the   TISCO   factory.   In   his   speech,   he  attributed   their   victory   to   the   railway  tracks supplied by India, the success of  the Allies in Egypt, Palestine and East  Africa.   In   his   testimony,   the   Viceroy  stated   that   the   Indians   have   high  potential, if they put their mind to it.  Germany   was   a   country,   which  promoted   nationalism.   India   also   was  greatly influenced by nationalism. However,  it is important to understand the fundamental  difference between German nationalism and  Indian   nationalism.   Germans   were   out   to  conquer   other   countries.   Their   aggression  was   for   making   their   own   country   most  powerful   and   the   biggest   in   the   world,  whereas   the   nationalism   of   the   Indians  was making them fight for regaining their  independence. The Indian nationalism was  based   on   a   broader   perspective   of   the  spread   of   democracy   all   over   the   world  including   India.   Countries   like   Abyssinia,  Spain, China were putting up struggles for  establishing   democracy.   Indians   were  sending help to those countries in the form  of   teams   of   nurses,   volunteers   and   food  grains.   Germany   was   strongly   influenced  by   racism.   Hitler   had   killed   innumerable  European Jews. However, in India people  of   varied   religion,   race   and   caste   were  staying   together   from   ages.   This   is  characteristic of Indian nationalism, which  confirms its magnanimity.  8.3.2   Second World War and India   :  The Second World War was fought during  1939-1945 C.E. India was involved in the  war   episodes   happening   in   North   Africa,  Egypt,   Iraq,   Iran,   Greece,   Myanmar   and  Malaya. However, India contributed to the  rehabilitation   of   Malaya,   Indonesia   and  China after the war was over. Indians in  the Air Force of British India participated  in the war at Assam and Myanmar, while  Indians in the Navy of British India fought  in the naval war in Arabian Sea and Bay  of Bengal. England exploited India and its  resources heavily to achieve victory in this  world   war.   India,   by   itself,   did   not   have  For additional information:   Thirty  one   Indian   soldiers   and   officers   were  honoured and decorated with ‘Victoria  Cross’, the highest and most prestigious  award   for   gallantry.   Among   the  recipients of Victoria Cross there were  two   individuals   from   Maharashtra   :  Naik   Yashwant   Ghadge   (5 th   Maratha  Light   Infantry)   and   Sepoy   Namdeorao  Jadhav (5 th   Maratha Light Infantry).

69  anything to gain from this war but it was  pulled in forcibly by the British Government.  The   British   fought   their   war   from   the  Indian   land.   For   them   India   was   their  colony and they took it in their right to use  it   as   a   source   of   supplying   industrial  products,   cloth   and   other   commodities   of  daily use to their allied nations. Their war  supplies   from   India   included   dynamite,  tanks, material required for ship repairing,  steel   pipes,   steel   bars   and   other   material  for   laying   railway   tracks,   train   bogies,  wood,   telegraph   posts,   smaller   war   ships  and steam ships, food grains, cloth, tents,  shoes, medicines, explosives and ammunition  and   such   things.   The   British   Government  established   several   factories   in   India   to  meet   the   requirement   of   supply   of   these  materials.  8.4   Impact   of   the   World   Wars   on  India  During   wartime   England   felt   an  increasing need for manpower and money.  Therefore,   the   British   Government   began  recruiting   army   personnel   from   India.   At  times   the   recruitment   was   enforced   on  Indians. Extra taxes were levied on Indians  for   raising   funds.   Taxes   on   trade   and  industries   were   raised.   During   the   war  period prices of essential commodities went  up. Along   with   the   inflation   and   hike   in  prices,   Indians   also   suffered   because   of  increasing   unemployment   caused   by  industrial recession.  Indians could see that the exploitative  rule of the British was responsible for this  miserable state of affairs. Indians from all  strata of the society, workers, farmers and  the middle class, joined in large numbers  in the national movement against the British  rule.  September 1939 saw the emergence of  Second World War. Initially it was England  and   France   against   Germany   and   Italy.  When   England   declared   war   against  Germany,   the   Viceroy   of   India   Lord  Linlithgow announced that India also was  joining the war, to support England.  The Indian National Congress protested  against   the   Viceroy’s   announcement.   The  Congress   was   against   the   German   and  Italian   ideologies,   which   were   inclined  toward   aggressive   dictatorship   and   also  against   England’s   colonialism   inclined  toward imperialism. England claimed that  it was fighting for protecting democracy in  Europe.   The   Indian   National   Congress  demanded that if   England was true to its  words   then   it   should   immediately   grant  India’s freedom. The Congress also made  a commitment that India, as an independent  nation   would   help   England   in   the   war  against   Germany.   It   was   also   announced  that   if   the   imperialistic   administration   of  the   British   Government   in   India   was   to  prevail,   then   Indians   will   not   help   the  British.   However,   Lord   Linlithgow  announced that the British Government will  not ponder upon any of the Indian issues  till   the   end   of   the   war.   Reacting   to   this  announcement the Indian National Congress  decided   not   to   participate   in   any   of   the  tasks related to war.  At about the same time, Japanese army  reached the eastern border of India. There  were   thousands   of   volunteers   who   had  joined   this   army. They   were   the   patriotic  members   of   ‘Azad   Hind   Sena’.   Netaji  Subhash   Chandra   Bose   was   their   leader.  His   policy   was   to   take   advantage   of   the  situation   to   move   the   Indians   for   intense  opposition to the British, while the British  were   engaged   in   war.   He   felt   that   even  enemy of the British may be approached  for help, if the need be. Azad Hind Sena  fought   fiercely   for   attaining   its   goal,   i.e.  independence   of   India   and   contributed   to  India’s freedom struggle.

70  For additional information  Dr.   Dwarkanath   Kotnis   :  Dr. Kotnis was born on 10th October  1910 at Solapur. He  worked   in   China  during   the   Second  World War, helping  the   injured   Chinese  soldiers to heal and  recuperate.   When  Japan had attacked  China   in   1937,   the  Chinese   Government   requested   Pandit  Jawaharlal   Nehru   to   send   a   team   of  doctors   to   attend   the   injured   Chinese  soldiers. Pandit Nehru sent a team of  Indian doctors to China. Dr.Kotnis was  the chief of the team. He attended the  Chinese soldiers for years. Unfortunately  Dr.   Kotnis   died   in   China   on   9th  December 1942 in the plague epidemic.  Dr. Kotnis by the virtue of his selfless  work   formed   the   bridge   of   friendship  between India and China. The eminent  Indian film-maker, V. Shantaram made  a film on his life, entitled, ‘Dr. Kotnis  ki   Amar   Kahani’.   This   film   has  immortalised Dr. Kotnis’ memory.  The   residence   of   Dr.   Kotnis   in  Solapur   has   been   converted   in   his  memorial and a museum.  Dr.Dwarkanath Kotnis  For additional information :   During  World   war   II   Sam   Hormusji   Framji  Jamshedji   Manekshaw   was   sent   under  the   17th   Infantry   Division   to   prevent  Japanese   attacks   in   Myanmar.   Sam  Manekshaw was appointed as the acting  Commander.   The   army   attacked   the  Sittang   Bridge   under   his   leadership.   It  was   very   crucial   to   win   over   this  important station.   The enemy attacked  Sam   Manekshaw.   He   was   hit   by   nine  bullets fired from the Japanese machine  guns.   Maj.   Gen.   David   Cowan,   senior  commanding   officer,   witnessed  Manekshaw’s   unmatched   valour   and  personally came to meet him. He pinned  his   own   Military   Cross   ribbon   on  Manekshaw.   A Military Cross could be  awarded only to a soldier who is alive.  Manekshaw   was   rushed   to   a   hospital.  Later he was appointed as the first Field  Marshall of independent India.  In   the   month   of   August   1945   the  Second World War was finally concluded.  In this war England emerged victorious but  it lost heavily in terms of human life and  economic conditions. As a result, England  grew   weaker.   The   British   Government   in  India, now aware that Indian soldiers and  people   are   not   meek   and   submissive   as  before, ruling them was no more easy. Also  India   was   not   going   to   be   the   perennial  source of profit for them as it used to be.  They decided to return home.  The two world wars caused loss of life  and wealth to a great extent. The awareness  that there should be an effective measure  to   avoid   such   wars   in   future   made   the  victorious   nations   create   organisations  called ‘League of Nations’ after the First  World War and ‘United Nations’ after the  Second   World   War.   India   has   contributed  significantly   in   the   work   of   these  organisations.  In the next lesson, we shall be studying  the process of ‘Decolonisation’ in Asia and  Africa.

72  In this lesson, we are going to review  the process of decolonisation in Asia and  Africa.   We   shall   do   it   with   examples   of  the history of a few countries.  9.1 Decolonisation : Asia  In the first half of the twentieth century  decolonisation   did   not   take   very   long,   in  many of the Asian and African countries.  The   process   of   decolonisation   was  accelerated   in   short   time   because   of   the  conflicts   among   European   coloniser  countries,   occurrence   of   First   and   Second  World Wars and the anti-colonial movements  in   the   colonies.   The   European   countries  could   not   have   reasoned   out   colonisation  and   the   exploitation   of   colonies   from  intellectual   platform.   The   Indian   freedom  movement   had   reached   culminating   point,  under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi.  Under   the   situation   England   had   become  aware   of   the   reality   of   their   diminishing  power. This resulted in gradually introducing  the system of internal autonomy in some  of the colonies.  Germany and Turkey were defeated in  the   First   World   War.   To   manage   the  administration of the colonies which were  under control of   Germany and Turkey, the  ‘League of Nations’ introduced the system  of   trustees.   England   and   France   were  entrusted   with   the   role   of   trustees.   Later,  India,   Cyprus   and   Malta   successively  gained their independence. In 1971 England  withdrew its army from the Gulf of Iran.  After   that,   England   released   its   hold   on  Singapore.   Indo-China,   Morocco,   Tunisia  and Algeria were under French domination.  These   countries   became   independent.   By  the end of twentieth century South Africa  also   gained   independence.   Colonialism  came to an end and gradually the process  of   decolonisation   was   completed.   ‘United  Nations’   was   largely   responsible   for  facilitating this process.  Maldives :   Portuguese entered Maldives  in 1507. Since then Maldives began paying  tribute to Portuguese in Goa. In 1573 the  Portuguese rule was ended by Muhammad  Thakuruphanu   Al   Azam   from   Malabar.  After   his   accession   as   the   Sultan   of  Maldives, he made a treaty with the Dutch  9.   World : Decolonisation  9.1 Decolonisation : Asia  9.2 Decolonisation : Africa  For   additional   information   :   The  process of decolonisation is supposed to  have   received   a   momentum   mainly  because   of   the   document   known   as   the  “Atlantic   Charter”.  This   Charter   was  published together by  Winston   Churchill,  Prime   Minister   of  England and Franklin  Roosevelt,   President  of   America.   The  charter stated that the  allied nations including  England and America did not intend to  grab any kingdom or country, the changes  in political system and geographic borders  of   any   country   in   the   post-war   period  would happen only according to the wish  of the citizens of the respective country  and it was granted that all people in the  world   have   the   right   to   take   their   own  decisions.

73  and   gave   them   the   administrative  responsibility   of   Maldives.   From   thereon,  the Sultan of Maldives began to pay tribute  to the Dutch in Sri Lanka (Ceylon). Later,  Maldives   was   taken   over   by   the   British.  They   built   a   naval   base   and   a   radio  transmission centre in Maldives. They also  took Indian labourers to work in the paddy  fields   in   Maldives.   Maldives   became  independent on 26th July 1965, by a treaty  signed at Colombo.  Sri   Lanka   :   The   British   ruled   Sri  Lanka (Ceylon) from 1798 to 1948. They  took over Sri Lanka by defeating the Dutch  and   the   Portuguese.   There   were   uprisings  in Sri Lanka against the British rule. The  British plantation owners had taken many  labourers   from   Tamil   Nadu   to   work   in  coffee plantations. In Sri Lanka, the British  dominated   the   production   and   markets   of  coffee,   tea,   rubber   and   coconut.   They  developed Colombo as an international port  city.   They   also   established   colleges   and  universities   in   Sri   Lanka   and   encouraged  Buddhist   Studies.   Sri   Lanka   became  independent in 1948.  Myanmar   (Brahmadesh)   :   In   1599,  the Portuguese defeated the king of one of  the   kingdoms   in   Myanmar.   However,   in  1611 various dynasties ruling in Myanmar  got   together,   defeated   the   Portuguese   and  amalgamated   their   kingdoms.   United  Myanmar   adopted   an   expansionist   policy  and   conquered   Manipur   and   Assam.   It  meant that the British Indian territory was  under threat of being invaded, a situation  that caused three wars between the British  and Myanmar. The first war in 1826 was  won   by   the   British   and   they   took   over  Assam   and   Manipur.   They   also   defeated  Myanmar in the second war. At about the  same time the French had taken over the  regions of ‘Upper Burma’ * . In the third war  the   British   won   this   region   too,   thereby  ruling over entire Myanmar.  * The central and northern region of Myanmar  is traditionally known as ‘Upper Burma’ comprising  Mandalay and surrounding region.  The   British   administration   annexed  Myanmar as a province of British India. In  1935,   it   was   again   separated   from   India  and was granted autonomy. After 1937 the  people in Myanmar created an organisation  called   ‘Burma   Independence Army’ under  the   leadership   of   Aung   San.   This  organisation   helped   the   Japanese   during  Second   World   War.   It   looked   like   a  downslide   for   the   British.   However,   they  strengthened   their   hold   in   Myanmar   once  again with the help of America in 1945.  The   British   learnt   their   lesson   that   as  administrators,   they   could   not   afford   to  neglect   the   popular   opinion   in   a   country.  They appointed Aung San as Vice President.  The   British   granted   independence   to  Myanmar on 4th January 1948.  9.2 Decolonisation : Africa  During the 15 year’s period of 1950-  1965, people in the European colonies in  Africa   freed   themselves   from   the   foreign  rule. The education system imposed by the  Europeans   was   alien   to   them.   Ironically,  African leaders were trained in this alien  educational system and their education had  introduced them to American Independence  Struggle,   French   Revolution   and  Nationalism.   The   African   people   became  aware of ‘Nationalism’ and national pride.  After the Second World War nationalism  got   a   further   boost.   England   and   France  gradually began to grant more rights to the  Africans in their colonies. This strengthened  the   independence   movements   in   African  nations.  Bandung   Conference   :   India   called  the   first   conference   of Asian   countries   in  1947. Representatives of 25 Asian countries  were   present   for   the   conference.   In   this  conference the concept of Asian regionalism

=== Page 84 ===

74  was   shaped.   The   issues   like   common  problems faced by Asian people, the social,  economic   and   cultural   problems   of   the  Asian countries and the need of mutual co-  operation   among   Asian   countries   were  discussed in this conference. This conference  was   followed   by   the   first   conference   of  Asian and African countries held in 1955  at Bandung in Indonesia. This is known as  the ‘Bandung Conference’. In this conference  the problems of Afro-Asian countries were  discussed and it was decided to focus on  world peace and mutual co-operation.  Concept   of   African   Unity   :   H.S.  Williams was the first person to think of  African Unity. He formed an organisation  while   in   London,   called   ‘African  Association’   (later   called   as   Pan-African  Association).   He   organised   its   first  conference   in   1900.   W.E.B.   Du   Bois,   an  American sociologist of African origin was  present   in   this   conference.   In   1919   a  second   conference   of African   leaders   and  thinkers was held at Paris, known as ‘Pan-  African   Congress’.   Thereafter,   W.E.B.   Du  Bois and his associates called a series of  Pan-African   congresses   at   various   places.  This   resulted   in   the   idea   of   Pan-African  unity taking deep roots in Africa. The 5th  Pan-African   Congress   held   at   Manchester  in 1945 by people of African origin living  in Manchester.  Decolonisation   in   the   African  Continent :   The First World War began in  1914.   At   that   time   except   Liberia   and  Ethiopia, entire African continent was ruled  by European powers. European colonies in  Africa, i.e. almost the entire continent, got  involuntarily   involved   in   the   war.   Soon  after   the   onset   of   the   war   England   and  France began to attack the German colonies  in Africa. After the defeat of Germany in  the   war,   allied   nations   began   to   compete  with   each   other   for   occupying   German  colonies in Africa.  The   American   President,   Woodrow  Wilson, considering the situation, suggested  that the victorious European nations should  act   as   trustees   of   the   erstwhile   German  colonies   and   administer   them   only   as  protectorates. It was necessary to give the  colonies   internal   autonomy.   Hence,   the  ‘League   of   Nations’ decided   with   mutual  understanding   that   England,   France   and  Belgium should divide the colonies among  themselves   in   1919.   A   Committee   of   11  members was appointed by the ‘League’ to  supervise the administration of the colonies.  The four British colonies, namely, Cape  Colony,   Natal,   Orange  Free State and Transvaal  were   amalgamated   and  the state of South Africa  was   created   in   1920.  However, the dominance  of   the   white   people  continued   unchanged.  Egypt   got   its  independence   before   the  end   of   Second   World   War.   Following   it  Libya,   Tunisia,   Morocco,   Algeria   and  Ghana   became   independent   one   after  another.  At   about   the   middle   of   the   twentieth  century in all 12 French colonies, such as  Ivory Coast, Madagascar, Mali in central  Africa became independent. Along with it,  Cameroon,   Somalia   and   other   colonies  under the care of the League of Nations,  and also other European colonies became  independent, one by one.  Algeria had to give a tough fight to  get its freedom. Finally in 1962 it became  independent   by   conducting   plebiscite.   In  1964,   Tanganyika   and   Zanzibar   were  amalgamated and the independent state of  ‘The   United   Republic   of   Tanzania’ came  into existence.  Prior to Second World War, Italy had  Woodrow Wilson

75  taken over Ethiopia and Libya and annexed  it to the Italian empire. During the Second  World War, Mussolini, the dictator of Italy  had used these two regions for launching  attacks on Egypt and other British colonies  in Africa.  The African   battlefield in   the   Second  World War had spread from Morocco and  Libya in the north to Ethiopia and Somali  Land on the eastern border of Africa. The  British   empire   in   Africa   was   in   danger  because of the aggressions of Italy and the  German   General   Erwin   Rommel.   Indian  soldiers   in   the   British   army   who   fought  with great resilience. With their help, the  British could compel the combined armies  of Italy and Germany to retreat. Italy and  Germany   had   to   lose   their   colonies   in  Africa at the end of the Second World War  in 1945.  Discuss in the class.  Make   a   list   of   the   colonies   of   the  British   in   Asia   and   Africa   with   their  geographical locations and discuss in the  class   about   their   independence   struggle  and the dates of their independence.  The   end   of   the   Second   World   War  created an environment in which the process  of   decolonisation   gained   momentum.   The  Asian   and   African   continents   were   filled  with   a   heightened   spirit   of   independence  movements.   The   awareness   about   these  movements spread rapidly. Many countries  in both continents obtained their freedom.  However,   developments   in   these   countries  were also being watched by America and  Russia, the superpowers. Each of them was  trying to attract maximum countries on its  side. In the next lesson, we are going to  study   the   ‘Cold   War’ and   its   impact   on  India.

77  We are going to study the concept  of ‘Cold War’ in this lesson.  10.1 Cold War : Definition  The   tussle   between   Capitalist   nations  and   Communist   nations   for   power   and  ideological influence, which began after the  Second World War is referred to as ‘Cold  War’.  Walter Lippmann, an American political  columnist   was   the   first   to   use   the   term  ‘Cold War’. The concept of ‘Cold War’ is  characterised by the following factors:  Europe.   Thus,   Europe   was   divided   in  Eastern and Western Europe. The Eastern  European   nations   under   the   influence   of  Soviet Russia adopted communist ideology.  The   Western   European   nations   under   the  influence   of   America   adopted   capitalist  ideology   and   democratic   system.   This  situation   caused   the   emergence   of   ‘Cold  War’.  10.   Cold War  10.1   Cold War : Definition  10.2   NATO,   ANZUS,   SEATO,  CENTO, Warsaw Pact  10.3   Non-Aligned   Movement   (NAM)  -   India’s policy  10.4   India’s Anti - Colonial Policy  10.5   South   Asian   Association   for  Regional Co-operation  10.6 Commonwealth  Background   of   Cold   War   :   The  aftermath   of   Second   World   War   created  conditions   leading   to   the   onset   of   Cold  War. England and France lost their primary  positions in the world politics. During the  world   war   Russia   gained   prominence   in  Eastern   Europe,   while   America,   England  and France gained prominence in Western  Do you know   ?  The   Prime   Minister   of   England,  Sir   Winston   Churchill   used   the   term  ‘Iron   Curtain’   for   the   divisive   line  between Eastern European nations with  the   communist   ideology   and   Western  European nations with the democratic  ideology.  Try to do this.  Collect   information   about   ‘United  Nations’ with the help of internet. Create  groups   of   students   in   the   class   and   let  them compile the information of various  specialised agencies of United Nations.  Progression of ‘Cold War’ :   After the  Second World War was over, America had  a ‘Marshall Plan’ for post-war reconstruction  of Europe. Under this plan America started  providing   financial   help   to   these   nations.  Soviet   Russia   started   encouraging   the  freedom   movements   in   Asia   and   Africa.  Because   of   the   division   of   Europe   into  Eastern   Europe   and   Western   Europe   a  political   tension   was   created   between  America   and   Soviet   Russia.   Although,   a  direct war between them never took place,  the sense of the looming Third World War  prevailed   at   global   level.   However,   both  parties   have   been   mutually   avoiding   any  1.   No Direct War  2.   Incense race for armament.  3.   Aggressive Political Policies  4.

78  possibilities   of   such   world   war.   Now   the  situation was such that both, America and  Russia,   perennially   appeared   to   be   ready  for a war, tension prevailed on both sides  but   actual   war   did   not   happen.   This  situation,   by-and-large,   is   referred   to   as  ‘Cold War’.  Europe   was   divided   after   the   Second  World   War   on   the   basis   of   political,  economic and military concerns. However,  the division of Europe leading to the Cold  War was mainly based on the ideological  differences. Ideology is fundamental to the  national   goals   and   aspirations.   The  communist ideology of Soviet Russia was  based   on   the   principle   of   governmental  ownership   and   the   capitalist   ideology   of  America   was   based   on   the   principle   of  private ownership.  The Cold War did not remain restricted  only   to   Europe,   but   it   spread   to   Asian  continent as well. Two major events took  place   in   the   first   half   of   the   twentieth  century. They were, the ‘Sino-Soviet Treaty  of Friendship’ and the ‘Korean Conflict’.  The Cold War began during the times  of Russian Premier Stalin. He was succeeded  by Nikita Khrushchev, who understood the  destructive nature of nuclear war, brought  changes   in   the   past   Soviet   policies   and  adopted   policies   based   on   more   realistic  outlook.   He   looked   forward   to   create   a  peaceful   coexistence   between   Russia   and  America.   His   policies   could   make   the  meeting possible between him and American  President, Eisenhower.  Soviet Russia Group   America Group  East Germany,  Poland,  Czechoslovakia,  Hungary, Romania,  Bulgaria, Albania  Netherlands,  Denmark, Belgium,  West Germany,  France, Italy, Spain,  Greece, United  Kingdom  Ideology -  Communist  Ideology - Capitalist  Economy –  Governmental  Ownership  Economy – Private  Ownership  Defence Treaties  – Warsaw Pact,  Sino-Soviet Treaty of  Friendship 1950.  Defence Treaties –  NATO, ANZUS,  SEATO, CENTO  In   1959,   the   President   of   America,  Mr.   Eisenhower   and   the   Soviet   Russian  leader Mr. Nikita Khrushchev met at Camp  David in America.  In 1961, Soviet Russia built the ‘Berlin  Wall’. This prevented the contact between  West Berlin and East Berlin. This instance  resulted in increased tension in Europe. In  1962,   Cuba   became   the   centre   of   the  tension created by the Cold War because  of   the   deployment   of   nuclear   missiles   to  Cuba by Soviet Russia. This incidence is  known as ‘The Cuban Missile Crisis’. To  reduce this tension between the two countries  measures   like   bilateral   agreement,  establishing a Moscow-Washington hotline  for   instant   communication   were   taken.   In  1972,   the   American   President   Richard  Nixon   and   the   Premier   of   Soviet   Russia,  Leonid   Brezhnev   met   at   Moscow.   In   the  America-Soviet Russia summit held in that  year at Moscow, it was unanimously agreed  upon to put a limitation on the number of  nuclear   missiles.   This   agreement   reduced  the   tension   between   the   two   countries   to  some   extent.   In   the   same   year   America  officially   acknowledged   People’s   Republic  of China as a State. The process of relaxing  the political tensions is referred as ‘détente’.  Later,   the   American   President   visited  China   and   officially   recognised   the  communist government of China. Both of  them used ‘Veto’ in ‘Security Council’ of  the   United   Nations,   on   various   instances  like   supporting   friend   nations,   signing   of  various   military   treaties,   economic  exchanges,   trading   concessions,   granting  the status of ‘friend nation’. This indirectly

79  promoted division of the member nations in  distinct groups. This resulted in highlighting  the   ideological   differences   between  Capitalism and Communism, thus creating  mutual fear and disbelief. There was lack  of   any   effective   system   that   would   clear  political misunderstandings. Ultimately the  Cold War remained alive for sometime.  The   Decade   of   ‘Détente’:   America  and Russia decided to continue the process  of détente. The Paris Conference in 1973  was   an   attempt   of   ending   the   Vietnam  War.   The   peace   talks   were   furthered   in  1975 Helsinki Conference. This conference  was   attended   by   representatives   of   35  European countries along with the President  of   America   and   the   Premier   of   Soviet  Russia. This conference was organized to  lessen   the   strain   between   eastern   and  western   European   countries. A conference  was held at Camp David in 1978 to resolve  the strife between Israel and Arabs.  In 1979, there was a revolution in Iran.  The   last   Monarch   (Shah)   of   Iran   was  overthrown and Ayatollah Khomeini became  the   supreme   leader   of   the   country.   Iran  suspended   all   diplomatic   relations   with  USA and also withdrew from ‘CENTO’. In  the   same   year,   Russia   intervened   in  Afghanistan   and   established   a   socialist  government under the leadership of Babrak  Karmal.  There was an intense competition for  developing   nuclear   weapons   and   space  programmes   between America   and   Soviet  Russia.  The field of sports was also subjected  to the Cold War politics.  America and Soviet Russia were aware  that their policies could inevitably lead to  the   Third   World   War.   However,   both  wanted   to   avoid   it.   Treaties   limiting   the  number of nuclear weapons were signed by  both   the   countries   and   the   possibility   of  Third World War was avoided.  Mikhail   Gorbachev’s   Era   :   Mikhail  Gorbachev   became   the   General   Secretary  of the Communist Party of Soviet Russia  and the Premier of Soviet Russia in 1985.  His period saw the end of Cold War.   He  introduced   important   reforms   in   Soviet  Russia   through   his   policies   known   as  ‘Perestroika’ (Restructuring) and ‘Glasnost’  (Openness).   During   his  times   the   Russian  economy   had   grown  weaker.   Gorbachev   tried  to   normalise   it   by  restructuring the political  and economic systems of  Soviet   Russia.   He  attempted to democratise  the   political   system   by   way   of   open  elections and to end the authoritarian rule  of   the   communist   party.   He   decentralized  the   economic   machinery   of   the   state.  Authors,   journalists   and   intellectuals   were  given more freedom of expression. However,  Gorbachev,   who   gave   momentum   to   the  process of unification of the East and West  Germany could not stop the disintegration  of   his   own   country.   Soviet   Russia  disintegrated during his period. After 1991,  two new terms were coined in the global  history;   ‘Post   Cold   War   World’ and   Post  Soviet Russia world order’.

80  You would like to know :  In 1945 the allied nations captured  Germany’s   capital,   Berlin.   A   plan   of  political reorganisation of Germany was  drawn.   Russia   though   France   did   not  contribute   in   any   way   in   this   victory.  Hence, Russia was unwilling to include  France   in   this   plan.   Even   then   France  was   included   in   this   plan   along   with  Great Britain and America. The discord  caused by the inclusion of France came  to   be   known   as   ‘Berlin   Conflict’.  Germany   was   split   into   East   Germany  and West Germany. East Germany was  under   Russia’s   control,   while   West  Germany   was   controlled   by   England-  America.   East   Germany   under   Russia’s  control.   Soviet   Russia   began   to   erect  Berlin wall in 1961. German citizens in  both sections of Germany had to face the  misery   of   broken   families   and   severed  relations. The Germans hated the ‘Berlin  Wall’. It was called ‘Wall of Shame’ by  them. Later in the years of 1989 and 1990  Berlin   Wall   was   brought   down   and  Germany was reunited.  Aftermath of the ‘Cold War’:   During  the period of Cold War there were many  factors, which threatened the very future of  mankind.   They   included   political  misunderstandings   among   nations,   world’s  nations   splitting   into   two   distinct   groups,  priorities   to   secret   political   moves   and  treaties, obsence of priority to the process  of disarmament, use of science for producing  destructive weapons, neglect of basic and  important   issues   like   food,   clothing   and  housing, etc. Both, USA and Soviet Russia  had to pay very heavily for their strategy  of letting the situation of Cold War prevail  over prolonged period.  The   consequence   of   dissolution   of  Soviet   Russia   left   USA   as   the   only  superpower in the world.  Now, we shall review the treaties and  agreements signed by America and Soviet  Russia during the period of Cold War.  10.2   NATO,   ANZUS,   SEATO,  CENTO, Warsaw Pact  NATO   (North   Atlantic   Treaty  Organisation   -   1949)   :   NATO   was   an  alliance   created   to   protect   29   of   the  European   countries   from   the   expansionist  policy   of   Soviet  Russia. Its members  included   Norway,  France,   Italy,  Denmark,   Great  Britain,   America,  Netherlands,   Portugal,   Turkey,   West  Germany,   Greece,   Belgium,   Canada,  Iceland, Luxemburg and Spain.  Few of the important terms included  in the NATO alliance are as follows:  An   attack   on   any   of   the   member  countries of the alliance would be treated  as the attack on all member countries; all  of the member countries will try to maintain  peace   and   security;   any   of   the   mutual  issues   among   the   member   countries   shall  be resolved through discussions.  The   headquarters   of   NATO   are   in  Paris. America had a significant influence  in the decision making process of NATO.  To counter America’s influential position in  NATO, Soviet Russia brought together the  communist countries in Europe and signed  a   treaty   commonly   known   as   ‘Warsaw  Pact’.  NATO

81  ANZUS   Treaty   :  Australia   (A),   New  Zealand (NZ) and United  States   of America   (US)  signed   a   treaty   on   1st  September   1951.   This  treaty   signed   by   the  three   nations   for   their  collective   security   is  commonly known as ANZUS treaty.   These  nations   are   in   the   Pacific   Ocean   region.  Hence,   this   treaty   is   also   described   as   a  ‘three-way   defence   pact’   in   the   Pacific  region.  This was the first instance of its kind;  two nations in the British Commonwealth  were   independently   making   a   pact   with  America.   In a way, it indicated that these  countries   did not want England and France  to have any upper hand in the matters of  their national security. This treaty had one  more objective to protect the countries in  Pacific Ocean from communist China.  SEATO   (Southeast   Asia   Treaty  Organisation) :   England, America, France,  Australia,   New   Zealand,  Pakistan,   Thailand   and  Philippines came together  and   signed   a   treaty   on  8th   September   1954   at  Manila   (Philippines),   to  ensure   the   collective  defence   of   the   countries  in   Southeast   Asia.   This  treaty   is   also   known   as   ‘Southeast   Asia  Collective   Defence   Treaty’   or   ‘Manila  Pact’.   The   pact   was   mainly   intended   to  stop the spread of communism in Southeast  Asia.   It   was   decided   that   if   any   of   the  nations included in the pact was attacked,  then other nations signing the pact would  collectively stand up against it and in the  times of peace they would extend help for  the   social   and   economic   development   of  each other. However, there were a number  of   flaws   in   the   treaty.   Although,   it   was  named   as   a   treaty   of   southeast   Asian  countries,   only   three   countries   from Asia,  namely, Thailand, Philippines and Pakistan,  were included in it. Rest all were western  nations,   who   neither   geographically,   nor  historically   had   any   affiliation   with   the  three   Asian   countries.   They   were  geographically   distanced   from   Asia   by  thousands of kilometers. They did not have  any deep understanding of the problems of  the Asian countries. Therefore, the military  viability   of   this   treaty   was   very   limited.  The   headquarters   of   SEATO   was   located  in Thailand. However, the organisation did  not have its own military. In 1973, Pakistan  withdrew from it. In 1975, France stopped  providing monetory help to this organisation.  On   30th   June   1977,   this   organisation  was officially dissolved.  CENTO ( Central Treaty Organisation )   :  CENTO,   was   known   earlier   as   ‘Baghdad  Pact’ or ‘Middle East Treaty Organisation’  (METO), is a treaty  among four nations,  namely,   Turkey,  Pakistan,   Iran   and  England. This treaty  was signed on 24th  February 1955. Iraq  joined later.  In   1958,   in   a   military   coup,   the  monarchy of Iraq was removed from power  and   the   Iraqi   Republic   was   established.  Iraqi revolutionists overthrew the government  that   favoured   the   western   countries.   The  new   regime   opposed   Baghdad   Pact   and  Iraq withdrew from it in 1959.   With this,  the   name   of   the   pact   was   changed   to  CENTO and its headquarters were moved  to Ankara (Turkey).  CENTO  SEATO  ANZUS

82  America encouraged them to continue  the treaty with an intention to put a check  on   the   spread   of   communism   by   Soviet  Russia.   America   started   providing   the  member nations of CENTO economic and  military   aid.   It   was   afraid   that   if   Soviet  Russia attacked any of the member nations,  then all members should fight it collectively.  However, if such situation emerged in  reality, none of the member countries had  military capacity to fight. Excepting United  Kingdom, rest of the three were in need of  economic and technological aid but America  was too involved in many other matters, to  pay   attention   to   their   needs.   Hence,   the  member nations of CENTO were not very  satisfied.   They   wanted   to   withdraw   from  the treaty and act independently. Iran and  Pakistan withdrew from this treaty and the  CENTO became non-operational.  Sino - Soviet Security Pact :   Earlier,  Soviet Russia had signed a defence treaty  with   China   in   1950.   Now,   with   this   new  pact   Soviet   Russia   agreed   to   provide  economic,   industrial,   technological   aid   to  China.  Warsaw   Pact   :   To   oppose American  policies   and   to   strengthen   communist  nations,   Soviet   Russia   brought   together  seven communist countries in eastern and  central   Europe   known   as   ‘Eastern   Bloc’  and   signed   a   treaty   commonly   known   as  Warsaw   Pact.   Along   with   Soviet   Russia,  Albania,   Bulgaria,   Czechoslovakia,   East  Germany,   Hungary,   Poland   and   Romania  signed this treaty. Albania withdrew from  it in 1968.  10.3   Non-Alignment   Policy   of   India  and NAM  After the Second World War, without  joining either Soviet Russia’s allied group  or   America’s   allied  group,   India   adopted  the   policy   of  development   by   its  own   efforts   and   to  shape   its   own  strategies   leading  towards   peace.   This  policy   is   known   as  ‘NAM – Non-Aligned Movement’.  Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Dr Sukarno  (Indonesia),   Nkrumah   (Ghana),   Gamal  Abdel   Nasser   (Egypt)   and   Marshal Tito  (Yugoslavia)   were   the   architects   of   the  concept of NAM.  Non-Aligned   Nations   :   The   nations,  which adopts an independent foreign policy  based on the concept of peaceful coexistence,  supports other nations in their independence  struggle and does not involve themselves in  the military agreements or bilateral treaties  with   the   superpowers   is   known   as   ‘Non-  Aligned Nations’.  Non-Alignment is a concept concerned  more   with   progress   and   peace   than   war  and poverty, so it is more positive.  In   1961   a   conference   of   non-aligned  nations   was   called   at   Belgrade.   Belgrade  Conference   was   the   first   summit   of   the  Non-Alignment Movement. Representatives  of   25   countries   were   present   for   this  conference.   It   was   concluded   with   a  declaration   containing   27   columns.   It  consisted   of   several   demands   such   as   :  stop aggression in Asia, Africa and South  America,   make Algeria   and Angola   free,  Withdraw French army from Tunisia, Stop  intervention in Congo, Policy of racism in  South   Africa   stop,   give   natural   rights   to  Arabs in Palestine.

83  Criteria of Non-Aligned Movement  Criteria for Non-Alignment (Adopted  at Belgrade, 1961)  1.   The country should have adopted an  independent   policy   based   on   the  coexistence   of   states   with   different  political and social systems.  2.   Support   national   independence  movements.  3.   It   should   not   be   a   member   of   a  multi-lateral   alliance   concluded   in  the context of Cold War.  4.   It   should   not   be   a   member   of   a  bilateral   military   alliance,   or   a  regional defence pact in the context  of great power conflicts.  5.   It should not concede military bases  to foreign powers in the context of  great power rivalry.  The   next   conference   of   non-aligned  countries   was   held   in   October   1964,   at  Cairo (Egypt). Prime Minister of India, Lal  Bahadur   Shastri   attended   this   conference.  The   thrust   of   the   conference   was   on  preparing global awareness against forming  groups of nations based on military concerns  and   establishment   of   military   bases   in  foreign   countries. The   third   conference   of  the   non-aligned   nations   was   held   in  September   1970,   at   Lusaka   (Zambia).   In  this   conference   it   was   decided   that   non-  alignment   countries   strengthen   their   unity;  continue   the   policy   of   opposing   military  treaties, insist on equal status in international  relations   and   attempt   to   enhance  disarmament. Besides, it was also resolved  to end colonialism and racism; to put more  emphasis   on   mutual   co-operation   and   to  support   the   ‘United   Nations’.   The   fourth  Conference of the non-aligned nations was  held   in   1973,   at   Algiers   (Algeria).   This  conference,   put   up   some   demands,   such  as, developing a new economic system and  establishing   a   system   of   reporting  international news. The fifth conference of  the non-aligned nations was held in 1976,  at Colombo (Sri Lanka). It was decided in  this conference to try to create a new global  economy by lessening the influence of the  super   powers   in   the   field.   The   next  conferences were held in 1979, at Havana  (Cuba)   and   in   1983,   at   New   Delhi.   The  Palestinian cause and the support for the  independence   struggle   of   Southwestern  Africa   (now   Namibia)   was   supported  unanimously   in   the   conference   at   New  Delhi.  The conference of non-aligned nations  held at New Delhi was the 7th one. India’s  Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi in her speech  in this conference emphasised on ‘Freedom,  Development,   Disarmament   and   Peace’.  The main goal of the non-aligned movement  was, progress in the development of member  nations. In the conference held in 1986, at  Harare (Zimbabwe) a fund named ‘Africa  Fund’ was   raised   for   providing   necessary  aid to neighbouring nations of South Africa.  The issues of Namibia’s (Southwest Africa)  freedom and the racialism of South Africa  were discussed. In the conference held in  1992, at Jakarta (Indonesia), a demand for  more   facilities   in   the   field   of   commerce  and   trade;   as   also   a   demand   for   the  restructuring   of   the   United   Nations   were  put up.  Try to do this.  Review   the   proceedings   of   NAM  conferences   held   during   the   period   from  1992 to the Venezuela conference of 2016.  10.4 India’s Anti-Colonial Policy  India   is   acknowledged   as   a   great  democracy   in   the   world.   It   had   protested  against   imperialism   in   the   world   politics  even   during   pre-independence   days.   Soon

84  SAARC  after independence India adopted the policy  of active non-alignment in the international  politics. It does not mean that India would  distance itself from the vital international  issues but it would always strive to establish  global   peace.   India   would   not   tolerate  foreign intervention in its internal matters.  India shall respect the regional unity and  sovereignty   of   other   countries.   India  emphasises on the principle of ‘live and let  live’   supported   by   peaceful   co-existence.  The following examples are worth citing in  this regard.  In   the   post-independence   period,   in  1949,   a   conference   was   held   in   Delhi   in  which support was declared to the issue of  Indonesia’s independence. It was demanded  that   the   Dutch   should   leave   Indonesia  before   1950   and   grant   its   independence.  The   position   India   took   in   the   case   of  Africa is also very important. India took a  very   strong   initiative   in   demanding   the  independence   of   the   African   countries,  especially   the   protectorates   of   European  nations. India insisted that the foreign rulers  (colonialist   European   countries)   should  leave   the   colonies,   at   the   earliest.   India  also   insisted   that   various   institutions  associated with the United Nations should  expand   their   work   fields   and   facilitate  Africa to benefit by it. India spoke in the  United Nations about the atrocious treatment  meted   out   to   the   native   Africans.   India  cared   about   Africa   because   of   its   long-  standing   relations   with   African   countries.  Thousands   of   Indians   had   migrated   to  Africa   for   trade   and   to   work   on   the  sugarcane   plantations,   since   long   ago.   In  1896,   Indian   workers   had   gone   there   to  work on the Kenya-Uganda railway project.  Mahatma Gandhi showed Africa the path  of   satyagraha   for   getting   independence.  Thus, India had been on the forefront in  the struggle against colonialism.  10.5   South   Asian   Association   for  Regional Co-operation (SAARC)  Zia-ur Rehman, President of Bangladesh  felt that an organisation, which would work  for the economic and social development in  Asia needs to be established. Accordingly,  the   first   among   the  four   meetings   of  foreign   secretaries   of  Bangladesh,   India,  Bhutan,   Pakistan,   Sri  Lanka,   Maldives   and  Nepal   was   convened  in 1981, at Colombo.  In this meeting it was  decided   to   work   together   for   planning   of  regional   co-operation,   rural   development,  health,   demographic   issues,   trade,   etc.   In  1983,   the   foreign   ministers   of   the   above  mentioned   countries   published   the   ‘SARC  Declaration’   in   Delhi.   In   1985,   SAARC  was established at the summit meeting held  at Dhaka. The following are the objectives  of   SAARC,   as   declared   in   the   Dhaka  conference.  (1)   To   co-operate   for   the   rapid,   all-  round   development   of   member   nations.  (2) To oppose terrorism and smuggling of  narcotics. (3) To resolve problematic issues  and create mutual understanding for mutual  trust among nations. (4) To co-operate with  various organisations at regional, zonal and  international   levels,   working   with   similar  objectives.   (5)   To   work   on   international  level for collective well being.  SAARC   was   officially   established   in  Dhaka,   with   these   objectives   in   view.   Its  secretariat-general   was   established   at  Kathmandu. It was decided that members  should   meet   once   annually.   Annual  subscription   was   made   mandatory   for  raising the salary fund of General Secretary,  seven Directors and the staff. The duration  of   SAARC’s   Principal   Secretary’s   posting

=== Page 95 ===

85  was to be for three years and every nation  was to get to post their representative as  Principal Secretary, every year by rotation.  The leaders of the South Asian countries  reaffirmed   their   commitment   to   the   UN  Charter   and   the   principles   governing  sovereign   equality   of   States,   peaceful  settlement   of   disputes,   non-interference   in  internal affairs and non-use or threat of use  of force against the territorial integrity and  political independence of other States. They  reiterated that the United Nations constituted  the most important forum for the resolution  of   all   issues   affecting   international   peace  and security.  They   also   reaffirmed   their   deep  conviction   in   the   continuing   validity   and  relevance of the objectives of the Nonaligned  movement   as   an   important   force   in  international relations.  Challenges   for   SAARC   to   tackle   :  SAARC is laden with many difficult issues  to tackle such as economic disparity among  the member nations, expenditure allotment  for   defence,   inadequate   infrastructure,  underdevelopment   of   agricultural   sector,  rising   terrorism,   population   explosion,  insufficient trade, divergent political systems,  religious-lingual diversity, etc.  Success   of   SAARC   :   SAARC   has  done well in some of the fields mentioned  above.   For   example,   a   centre   for  dissemination   of   agro   related   information  was started in Bangladesh and it has been  also used as a platform for research related  to   seeds,   animal   husbandry   and   fisheries.  A   ‘SAARC’   centre   for   meteorological  research   was   established   in   Dhaka.   In  Kathmandu   an   orthopedic   centre   was  established.   Efforts   are   being   made   to  promote   tourism   in   SAARC   countries.  SAARC   is   also   working   for   eliminating  poverty in the countries in South Asia with  the   help   of   the   ‘Economic   and   Social  Commission for Asia and Pacific (ESCAP)’.  An   inter-Governmental   group   was  established   to   formulate   an   agreement  (SAFTA – South Asian Free Trade Area)  for promoting free trade and economic co-  operation among the SAARC nation. The  SAARC   Documentation   Centre   was  established   at   Delhi   for   dissemination   of  information.   SAARC   Human   Resources  Development   Centre   was   established   at  Islamabad   (Pakistan).   Agreements   were  signed to counter the smuggling of narcotic  drugs.   Committees   were   appointed   for  development in the fields of postal services  and transportation.  South   Asian   Preferential   Trade  Arrangement   -   SAPTA   and   South   Asian  Free Trade Area - SAFTA  With a view to enhance mutual trade  among   Asian   countries   two   treaties   were  signed, namely, SAPTA (1993) and SAFTA  (2004).

The   idea   behind   establishing  Commonwealth was to being the Governors  and administrators together who had worked  in   the   erstwhile   colonies   of   the   British  empire.   The   objective   was   to   achieve  coherence in the political and administrative  machinery by exchange of the experience  and ideas of these officers.  In   1917,   Canada,   Australia,   South  Africa   and   New   Zealand   were   given  autonomy   as   integral   states   of   British

=== Page 96 ===

86  COMMONWEALTH  Empire. In 1931, England declared a policy  of   granting   autonomy   to   all   its   colonies,  one by one. The British Parliament passed  a statute known as ‘Statute of Westminster’.  This   statute   approved   formation   of  Commonwealth.   As   the   tradition   would  have   it,   the   British   Queen   or   King   is  installed at the head of this organisation.  The secretariat of the Commonwealth was  established   at   London.   Voluntary   co-  operation   is   the   fundamental   principle   of  Commonwealth.  After   the   Second   World   War   the  British colonies in Asia and Africa became  independent.   The   commonwealth   deserves  credit for it to some extent. The opposition  to   British   rule   in   the   colonies   and   the  altered   international   scenario   made   the  disintegration   of   the   British   Empire  inevitable.   The   establishment   of  Commonwealth   proved   instrumental   in  giving   momentum   to   anti   colonial  movements in the colonies. Beside this the  ‘Commonwealth’   held   to   check   the  resentment with regard to granting freedom  to the colonies that prevailed in some social  strata in England. India’s decision to remain  in   the   Commonwealth   even   after   its  independence added to the nullification of  that resentment.  Commonwealth and India :   In 1948,  in   the   Congress   Session   at   Jaipur   in  Rajasthan, Pandit Nehru took the decision  of joining ‘Commonwealth’. India became  a member of Commonwealth as an equal  and sovereign state. The factors leading to  this   decision   were   in   the   situation   that  prevailed then. At that time England was  the   major   supplier   of   arms   and   other  defense   material   to   India.   England   had  granted same facilities to India with regards  to   foreign   exchange.  Indian   exported   goods  were   partially   free  from the customs duty.  More importantly India  had   an   open   platform  at   Commonwealth   to  counter   the  malpropaganda   by  Pakistan against India. By considering all  these   things   India   became   a   member   of  Commonwealth.  Apart from this India has always been  on the forefront in Commonwealth Games.  The   sports   competitions   modeled   after  Olympics competitions used to be held for  amateur sportsmen in the British colonies  under   the   name,   ‘British   Empire   Games’.  The idea of such games was introduced by  Reverend Astley Cooper. Since 1950 these  competitions   came   to   be   called   as  ‘Commonwealth   Games’.   Commonwealth  games were started at ‘Crystal palace’ to  mark   the   coronation   ceremony   of   King  George V in 1911.  The Commonwealth Games of 1986  were   of   special   significance.   Thirty   two  countries   boycotted   the   games.   These  countries   demanded   that   South   Africa  should change their racist policies. However,  United Kingdom did not pay any heed to  this   demand.   Hence,   Mr.   Rajiv   Gandhi,  India’s Prime Minister declared a boycott.  Now, in the 21 st   century India has recorded  a   laudable   performance   in   the  Commonwealth Games.  In the two lessons that follow, we are  going to learn about India as a country in  the process of transformation.

88  11.   India Transformed - Part I  This lesson reviews the advancements  in various fields, in   India since 1990. We  shall do this by citing a few representative  examples.  11.1 Globalisation  India before 1990 and India after 1990  are much apart. It adopted liberal economic  policies in 1990 and many things changed.  General   Agreement   on   Tariffs   and  Trade   (GATT)   :   During   the   times   of  Second   World   War   many   countries   had  adopted   the   policy   of   imposing   various  duties and taxes on imported goods, with  a   view   to   protect   their   home   markets.   It  resulted   in   declining   of   trade. A meeting  was called in Cuba to discuss this problem,  which was attended by 56 nations. It was  decided   to   establish   a   permanent  organisation to resolve the problems related  to   international   trade.   A   legal   agreement  was   signed   in   Geneva   by   23   nations   in  1947,   which   is   known   as   GATT.   This  agreement was the first multinational trade  agreement. GATT gave priority to economic  development through production and trade,  to   treat   the   member   countries   as   ‘most  favoured nations’.  11.1   Globalisation  11.2   Transformation in Various Fields  11.2.1 Rural Development Plans  11.2.2 Urban Development Plans  11.2.3 Means of Communication  11.3   Economic Issues  11.4   BRICS  11.5   Science and Technology  11.6   Defence Affairs  11.7   Youth related Policies  11.8   Right to Information Act 2005  11.9   Reorganisation of States  An   annual   meeting   of   the   member  countries   of   GATT   used   to   be   held   at  Geneva.   It   was   attended   by   the  representatives   of   the   member   countries.  Each   country   was   entitled   to   one   vote.  Problems   faced   by   individual   nations  regarding   the   difficulties   in   international  trade were discussed in the meeting and the  decisions were based on these discussions.  Later   GATT   became   a   part   of   a   more  encompassing organisation known as ‘World  Trade Orgnisation’ - WTO.  World Trade Organisation (WTO) :  On 1st January 1995, 123 nations together  founded an organisation with the objective  of opening the world for free trade. It was  called   World   Trade   Organisation   (WTO).  It’s a global trade organisation and India  is a member of it.  Arthur   Dunkel,   the  Director   General   of  WTO   prepared   a   draft  which   has   been  fundamental   to   the  establishment   of   the  organisation. This draft  is   known   as   ‘Dunkel  Draft’. The crux of this  draft   emphasises   on  trade, free from governmental customs duty  and   other   restrictions.   This   approach   is  known as ‘liberalisation’. All participating  countries agreed upon a set of rules and a  premise common to all that would promote  international trade. Initially provisions were  made   in   the   spheres   of   grants,   exports-  imports,   foreign   investments,   reserved  sectors, agriculture, technology and service  sectors.  After   becoming   a   member   of   WTO,  India put a thrust on economic progress. In  Arthur Dunkel

89  this   aspect   the   contribution   of   the   then  Prime Minister of India, Narsimha Rao and  Finance Minister Manmohan Singh is very  important.   Prime   Ministers   Atal   Bihari  Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh took ahead  the   policy   of   liberlisation.   The   report  published   by   WTO   in   2006   has   made   a  special   mention   of   increasing   economic  growth rate of India. Growth in investments,  fall in the ratio of population below poverty  line, fall in infant mortality rate, increasing  availability of facilities for literacy, potable  water   and   drainage   system   in   India,   are  also mentioned in this report. By adopting  ways   like   simplifying   import   rules,  modifying   laws   regarding   rights   on  intellectual property, modifying patent laws,  India entered the global economy.  11.2 Transformation in Various Fields  Transformation   of   a   nation   can   be  discerned through certain indicators. Is the  countryside   developing? Are   the   roads   in  our   vicinity   in   good   condition?   Has   the  traffic improved? Have the cities improved?  Have   the   communication   systems   become  more efficient? Has the defence machinery  of the country given priority to upgradation  and   modernisation   of   defence   systems?  Are the citizen in position to avail of their  rights   in   proper   manner?   If,   answers   to  such questions are affirmative, then we can  assert that the transformation is happening.  So, let us understand the transformations in  various fields that happened in our country.  11.2.1 Rural Development Plans  Several   plans   for   rural   development  have been implemented, so that the rural  sector   should   not   get   neglected   and   the  balance   between   rural   and   urban  development be maintained. The plans that  are being implemented in the present are  mostly   augmentation   of   plans   that   were  already   operational.   Sometimes   earlier  plans were merged in new plans.  To create employment opportunities for  an   ever   increasing   population   is   a   major  challenge   for   the   government.   We   shall  review the measures taken by the government  in this respect.  Pradhan Mantri Rojgar Yojana :   To  create job opportunities for educated youth  the   ‘Ministry   of   Commerce   and   Industry’  of the Government of India started a plan  on 2 nd   October 1993. This plan was meant  for   creating   opportunities   for   job   and  private enterprise.  ‘Pradhan   Mantri   Rojgar   Yojana’   and  ‘Rojgar Hami Yojana’ were started on the  birth   anniversary   of   Mahatma   Gandhi.  Rojgar Hami Yojana was to assure daily  wages   to   the   unemployed   agricultural  labourers. There are days when employment  of any kind is not available to agricultural  labourers. The objective of this plan was  to provide wage earning opportunity, who  were in search of it. Initially this plan was  launched in 257 districts in India. A goal  was   set   to   provide   work   to   two   young  labourers   in   each   family   below   poverty  line.   In   2001   this   plan   was   merged   in  ‘Gramin (Rural) Rojgar Yojana’.  In 1998, with a view to provide support  to farmers in difficult times, ‘Kisan Credit  Card’ plan was started. It was also intended  to help farmer to avail funds for essential  equipments and seeds for cultivation. Later,  an   insurance   facility   was   also   offered   to  farmers,   who   were   Kisan   Credit   Card  holders.  Suvarnajayanti   Gramin   Svayam  Rojgar Yojana :   This plan was launched  in 1999. This plan was started by merging  various   plans   together   namely   ‘Ekatmik  Gramin   Vikas   Yojana’,   Self   employment  training   programmes   for   rural   youth,  programme for rural women and children,  distribution   of   modern   equipment   to   rural  artisans, ‘Ganga Kalyan Yojana’ and plan

90  to dig 10 lakh wells etc. In 2005-06, there  were 12 lakh 7 thousand benefeciaries of  ‘Suvarnajayanti   Gramin   Swayam   Rojgar  Yojana’.  Jawahar Gram-Samruddhi Yojana :  In   1999, a new plan was implemented with  an intention to provide adequate employment  for   the   unemployed   men   and   women.   In  2001, it was merged in a plan known as  ‘Sampoorna Gramin Rojgar Yojana’.  Sampoorna Gramin Rojgar Yojana :  This plan was launched by merging together  ‘Rojgar Aashwasan Yojana’ and ‘Jawahar  Gram-Samruddhi   Yojana’   in   2001.   This  plan   made   provisions   for   creating  opportunities   in   rural   areas   of   earning  wages, to provide food-grains in exchange  of work, etc. In 2004, the scheme of giving  food-grains   in   exchange   of   work   was  started in 150 districts in the country which  were economically most backward. Measures  like   water   conservation,   development   of  agricultural   lands   were   given   priority   to  overcome situations of famine. In 2006 this  scheme was merged in ‘Rashtriya Gramin  Rojgar Hami Yojana’.  Rashtriya   Gramin   Rojgar   Hami  Yojna :   The Government of India launched  this scheme on national level to eradicate  economic disparity, poverty, starvation and  unemployment in rural India. Each family  in rural areas was given assurance of at  least 100 days’ work. Till 2008, this scheme  was started in about 350 districts.  Agriculture   and   Livestock   :   Along  with the nation’s transformation, agricultural  sector is also getting transformed. According  to 2011 census 54% of the total population  in India is engaged in agriculture and agro-  related   sector.   The   ‘Soil   Health   Card  Scheme’ aims at increasing the soil fertility  and   agricultural   production.   ‘Pradhan  Mantri Krishi Sinchan Yojana’ envisaged is  for giving priority to adequate water supply  for   agriculture   and   irrigation   facilities   on  larger scale. ‘Krishi Vikas Yojana’ aims at  organic   cultivation   and   increase   in   the  farmers’   income.   ‘Pradhan   Mantri   Vima  Yojana’ is   implemented   for   the   economic  welfare   of   the   farmer.   More   emphasis   is  given   on   fields   like   animal   husbandry,  dairy,   fisheries,   agricultural   research   and  education.   Focus   on   developing  ‘Agriculture’, ‘Co-operative establishments’  and   ‘Farmer   Welfare’ are   the   three   main  themes of the development programmes.  In 2007, a national policy for farmers  was adopted. Gradually, the results of all  the   programmes  implemented   for   the  agricultural   sector   are  becoming   apparent.   If  there is a crop failure,  because   of   things   like  natural   calamities,  pesticides,   epidemics,  adverse climate, etc. the  farmer gets compensated  through   the   insurance  scheme (‘Pradhan Mantri  Peek Vima Yojana’). Research institutes of  agricultural   science   are   supported   through  Indian   Council   for   Agricultural   Research  (I.   C.   A.   R.).   Agricultural   exhibitions   are  organised with the objective of introducing  the   farmers   to   latest   technology,   new  agricultural   experiments   and   research.  Indigenous seeds and indigenous breed of  cattle is given priority. Research programmes  on   ‘goat’   were   conducted   on   pan-Indian  level.   Goat   keeping   (Sheli   Palan)   is  encouraged as an occupation for enhancing  the   life   standard   of   tribal   people.   It   has  largely   become   their   principal   source   of  livelihood.   In   rural   areas   poultry   farming  of   indigenous   variety   was   encouraged.  Thus, India is making significant progress  in   the   fields   of   animal   husbandry,   dairy  and   milk   production,   fisheries,   live   stock,  Indian Council for  Agricultural Research  (I.C.A.R.)

91  poultry, meat and wool production. Ours is  a leading country in milk production. The  ‘National   Livestock   Mission’   was  established in 2014-15 and since then there  is rapid growth in the livestock sector. This  mission provides for availability of fodder,  loan,   organizing   the   cattle   keepers   and  resolving their difficulties. In 1919-20 the  first livestock census was conducted. Since  then it is being done regularly. The ‘2012  Livestock   Census’   was   nineteenth   in   the  series.   China   ranks   the   first   in   fish  production   while   India   ranks   the   second.  Fishing has been an important occupation  in India, which is now supplemented with  fish   farming   (pisciculture).   This   sector   is  growing rapidly.  Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana   :  The   Government   of   India,   knowing   the  importance   of   having   roads   in   good  conditions   in   the   interior   areas,   started  ‘Pradhan   Mantri   Gram   Sadak   Yojana’ in  2000. Initially, the work of building roads  began by linking the villages of population  strength up to 1000. In 2001, this programme  was merged in ‘Pradhan Mantri Gramoday  Yojana’. The roads measuring about 75000  Km. were completed till 2005. The purpose  of this work was to extend the benefits of  country’s economic growth to people living  in rural areas and to bring transformation  in   their   lives.   It   aimed   at   providing  amenities   for   good   health,   education,  drinking   water,   dwellings,   roads   and  electricity.  11.2.2 Urban Development Plans  Jnnurm – Jawaharlal Nehru National  Urban Renewal Mission :   This programme  was launched in 2005. The mission is for  massive   modernisation  of   the   cities   through  modifications   in   road  building, public transport,  wastewater disposal and  management   systems  and sewage disposal systems, housing for  the poor, etc.  Golden   Quadrilateral   (Suvarna  Chatushkon Yojana) :   In 1998, Government  of India announced a programme of creating  national highway network to join the four  megacities   -   Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and  Kolkata.   National   Highways   Authority   of  India is managing this project. This project  aimed at tasks like developing two highways  about   7300   km.   in   length   linking   all   the  four   quarters   of   the   country,   to   provide  rapid transportation to important port cities  in the country. The programme progressed  rapidly by completing ¼ of the total length  of the highways till 2008.  Metro   Railway   :   The   Delhi   Metro  railway   was   flagged   off   in   2002.   Metro  railway running above and underground has  introduced   a   major   change   in   the   public  transport system of the metropolises of India.  It facilitated speedy and smooth transit.  11.2.3 Means of Communication  Postal   Department   :   In   1766,   the  British established the post office in India.  Thus,   the   ‘Indian   Postal   Department’   is  more   than   250   years   old.   The   postal  department,   which   once   only   delivered  letters, has undergone total reformation. It  has   entered   in   the   field   of   banking.   The  postal   department   has   introduced   various  schemes such as, ‘Postal Savings Accounts’,  ‘Term   Deposits’,   ‘Public   Provident   Fund  (PPF)’,   ‘Kisan   Vikas   Patra’,   ‘Sukanya  Samruddhi Account’, and so on. To improve  its   services,   in   all   23,557   postal   offices  were   brought   under   ‘Core   Banking  Solutions’,   till   2018.   Automated   Teller  Machines   (ATM)   were   installed   at   many  branches.   Mutual   Fund   products   of   ‘Unit  Trust   of   India’   were   made   available   to  customers   at   postal   offices.   The   postal  department is also offering money transfer  services to Non Resident Indians.

92  Collect   information   of   following  schemes :  National   Pension   Scheme,   Pradhan  Mantri   Suraksha   Vima   Yojana,   Pradhan  Mantri   Jeevan   Jyoti   Vima   Yojana,   Atal  Pension Yojana, Indian Post Payments Bank.  Speed   Post   :   The   service   of   ‘Speed  Post’   changed   the   very   nature   of   Indian  Postal Service. This service was started in  1986.   Many people take advantage of this  service,   to   the   tune   of   more   than   three  crores of letters and parcels being delivered  every month. The postal department sends  a   message   of   successful   delivery   on   the  mobile   phone   of   the   sender.   This   facility  has   made   the   speed   post   service   more  reliable. In addition, the postal department  now offers courier services like delivery of  passport, business parcels, cash-on-delivery,  logistics   post   and   air   freights.   Earlier,   if  anybody   wanted   to   post   letters   or   gift  articles,   etc.   on   a   larger   scale,   the   tasks  like   putting   the   letters   in   envelopes   or  packaging   of   the   gift   articles,   the   sender  had to do them personally. Now the post  office offers the packaging service at extra  charge. This has increased the business of  the postal department. There are one lakh  and fifty five thousand post offices, which  are   offering   services   like   paying   various  bills,   sending   festive   greetings   cards   and  similar objects.  The   postal   department   has   started   a  very novel service since 2016 of delivering  Ganges   water   (Ganga   Jal)   at   personal  addresses   from   Rishikesh   and   Gangotri.  Along   with   it   facilities   like   buying  personalised postage stamps with a personal  photograph,   buying   newly   issued   postage  stamps at philatelic centres, special schemes  for philatelists are available at ‘Post Shops’  opened at 80 post offices.  Let us collect information.  Collect   information   about   various  services like ‘Sarvabhaum Suvarn Rokhe’  (Gold Bonds issued by the government),  ‘Electronic   Indian   Postal   Order’,  ‘E-Dakghar’, ‘E-Payment Portal’, ‘Mobile  App’ etc., by interviewing the Postmaster  of any branch.  Let us know :  Collect information with the help of  internet   about   the   ‘Rafi Ahmad   Kidwai  National Postal Academy’ (Gaziabad).  The postal department is also concerned  with   the   requirements   of   philatelists.  Philately is a valued hobby at international  level.   Special   limited   issues   of   artistic  postage stamps are published by the postal  department.   In   the   year,   from April   2017  to   March   2018,   the   postal   department  published   50   issues   of   postage   stamps  based   on   various   themes.   It   included   the  subjects like Meghalaya Caves, rare Indian  birds,   Ramayan,   Mahabharat,   Indian  cuisine, Winning designs of ‘nests’ from a  children’s   competition,   ‘Heritage’  architectural   wells   (for   example,   ‘Rani   ki  Vav’),   Hand   fans,   Solar   system,   Indian  headgears,   Centenary   of   the   Champarnya  Satyagrah,   etc.   The   postage   stamps   of  Ramayana were distributed in 40 countries  through the Indian embassies.  11.3 Economic Issues  An   example   is   cited   here   to   have   a  glance of the economic growth.

93  Ministry   of   Disinvestment   :   The  Government of India established a separate  ‘Ministry of Disinvestment’ to take care of  its   disinvestment   policy,   i.e.   the   gradual  withdrawal of governmental investment in  the   public   sectors.   The   Government   is  focusing on reducing its investment in the  sectors   like   mining,   petroleum   refineries,  roads   and   highways,   port   trusts,  telecommunication and foreign investments  in   these   sectors   are   now   permitted.   The  policies of ‘Privatisation, Liberilsation and  Globlaisation’   (popularly   known   as  ‘KHAUJA’),   boosted   the   confidence   of  Indian   companies   and   some   of   them  established themselves in global markets by  acquiring   foreign   companies   in   the   steel,  pharmaceuticals,   tea   production   and   also  automobiles sectors.  In 2016 the ‘Ministry of Disinvestment’  was renamed as ‘Department of Investment  and Public Asset Management (DIPAM)’.  11.4 BRICS  This   organisation   was   established   in  2006. Its name is formed by adopting the  first letter of the names of the participant  countries.   The   participant   member   are  Brazil,   Russia,   India,   China   and   South  Africa.   This   organisation   was   established  with an aim of enhancing the trade among  these   countries.   The   11th   conference   of  BRICS   was   organised   in   Brazil   in   2019.  The theme of this conference was ‘Economic  Growth for an Innovative Future’. Subjects  like technological co-operation, technology  and   innovation,   digital   economy,  international   crime,   financial   scams   were  discussed.   ( Ref. : BRICS.org.pib.nic.in )  11.5 Science and Technology  Only   a   few   instances   of   significance  are mentioned in this part.  A   super-computer   named   as  ‘Param-8000’ was created with the help of  C-DAC   (Centre   for   Development   of  Advanced Computing), Pune. In 1998, an  advanced   version   of   ‘Param-8000’   was  made, which was named as ‘Param-10000’.  Its   mathematical   potential   was   enormous,  because of which India entered the global  computer   market.   India   won   its   place  among   the   leading   countries   with   high  technological knowhow of computer making.  In 1999, a project of creating a still further  version of ‘Param-10000’ was undertaken.  This computer was named as ‘Parampadma’.  ‘Parampadma   Super   Computer’   was  dedicated to the nation in 2003.  The   Indian   software   industry   was  benefitted   because   of   the   policy   of  liberalisation.   The   central   government’s  favourable   policies   for   software   industry,  foresightedness of the Indian entrepreneurs,  the   nationwide   spread   of   computer   and  information technology, computer engineers  who   are   also   proficient   in   the   use   of  English   language   resulted   in   tremendous  increase in the Indian export of software.  It increased from 3.2% to more than 25%  after 2005.  In 1995, internet services began in the  Indian   metropolises.   In   2004,   Tata  Consultancy was the biggest firm in Asia  providing   software   services.   Pune   and  Bengaluru   developed   as   Information  Technology   (IT)   hubs.   The   population   in  India   using   internet   services   is   rapidly  increasing. Indian IT engineers are in great  demand all over the world.  In the field of science, India, to prove  its nuclear strength, conducted underground  nuclear   tests   two   times   at   Pokharan   in  Rajasthan. The Indian satellite, ‘Oceansat-1’  launched and entered the orbit in 1999 to  collect   oceanographic   information   (about  oceans   and   seacoasts).   In   2000,   ‘Bharat  Sanchar   Nigam   Ltd.,   (BSNL)   was  established to provide services like cellular  phones   (mobile   phones),   internet   and  broadband.

94  11.6 Defence Affairs  In   1999   Pakistan   intruded   Kashmir.  This intrusion started a war between India  and Pakistan. This war was fought in the  Kargil-Drass area in Ladakh. Hence it is  known as ‘Kargil War’. It is also referred  to as ‘Operation Vijay’ by the Indian army.  ‘Operation Vijay’ was successful and India  emerged victorious in it. This war alerted  the Indian authorities for modernisation of  the Indian military. Processes of updating  the military, equipments and arms, training,  etc. were further intensified.  In   2009,   India   successfully   built   a  ‘Strategic   Strike   Nuclear   Submarine’,   of  ‘Arihant’ Class. This was the first nuclear  submarine   built   in   India.   Its   first   patrol  round   was   completed   with   Russia’s  co-operation.   Thus,   India   is   the   sixth  country in the world to develop indigenous  technology of building nuclear submarines.  The Indian government had involved private  Indian entrepreneurs too, in this project.  Indian   Science   Congress  Association   :   This   association   was  established on 15 th   January 1914 with  the   objective   of   promoting   scientific  environment   in   India   and   publishing  dissertations,   research   papers   and  periodicals. In 1975, Asima Chatterjee  became the first female scientist to be  elected as the General President of the  62 nd   Indian   Science   Congress  Association.  In 2007, India entered a new field of  space   research.   It   commercially   launched  the   Italian   satellite.   Other   nations   had  submitted tenders quoting very high rates,  to get this contract. However, India got this  contract   by   quoting   reasonable   rates.  Nevertheless,   India   earned   considerable  profit   through   the   Italian   contract.   Before  entering   this   field   on   commercial   basis,  India had already successfully launched the  satellites   of   Argentina,   Belgium,   South  Korea, Indonesia and Germany.   In 2008,  India   launched   ‘Chandrayaan-1’,   the   first  lunar probe. Through the information sent  by   ‘Chandrayaan-1’,   India   could   collect  evidence for the presence of water on the  moon.   After   that   India   also   launched  ‘Chandrayaan-2’ and   ‘Mangalyaan’.  VVPAT- Voter Verified Paper Audit  Trail  The   Government   of   India   started  using   this   machine   for   the   Nagaland  Assembly elections in 2011. Since 2019,  this device has been widely used for Lok  Sabha elections. The slip generated by the  machine   can   be   checked   to   determine  whom you voted for. The voter sees the  slip in a few seconds after the vote. The  voter   can   confirm   his   or   her   own   vote  through this machine.  The   Government   of   India   emphasised  on   indigenous   production   by   using  indigenous   technology   (‘Make   in   India’),  on   recruiting   women   officers   in   military  and   also   on   combined   Exercise   with  militaries   of   other   nations.   There   is  increasing focus on the exchange of latest  technology, to fight terrorism, to augment  our own competencies and optimum use of  modern   technology   for   ending   terrorism.  The Exercise with Oman military at Bakloh,  Himachal Pradesh, is apparently the result  of these policies. In the Exercise with Nepal

There are a few reserved seats for women,  who have completed N.C.C. training.  11.7 Youth related Policies  India   is   a   country   with   maximum  proportion of young people. Individuals in  the age group of 15-29 are considered as  ‘Youth’.   The   ‘Youth’,   if   provided   with  opportunities of education and skill training,  can   contribute   significantly   in   the  development of India. A number of centres  of   ‘Nehru   Yuva   Kendra   Sangathan’ were  established   in   1972.   These   centres   began  training   young   people   for   various   skills.  The programmes run by these centres were  eventually   merged   in   ‘National   Youth  Empowerment Programme’. This programme  put   a   thrust   on  topics like literacy,  education,   health  and   hygiene,  family   welfare,  preservation   and  conservation   of  environment,   awareness   of   social   issues,  rural development and self employment.  12th   January   is   the   birth   anniversary  of   Swami   Vivekanand.   It   is   observed   as  ‘National Youth Day’. Every year, National  Yuth Festival is celebrated in the month of  January.   This   festival   is   organised   jointly  by the Government of India and one of the  State Governments. This festival is designed  to provide a platform for the artisitic talents  of young individuals.  ‘Youth   Hostels   Association   of   India’  has   established   youth   hostels   in   various  parts   of   the   country.   These   hostels   are  managed in collaboration by the Government  of India and respective state governments.  ‘Youth   Hostels   Association’   works   for  encouraging   the   adventure   skills   among  young people. There are about 83 hostels  Do you know   ?  Indian   military   is   the   first   to  give   training   to   foreign   women  officers.   During   a   training   session  organised in Chennai, women officers  in the Afghan Air Force were trained.  It   included   training   for   the  development of physical capabilities,  use   of   latest   arms,   war   strategies,  communication skills and leadership  qualities.   In   2016,   the   Indian   Air  Force   commissioned   three   women  pilots, for the first time. Their names  are,   Avani   Chaturvedi,   Bhavana  Kant   and   Mohana   Sigh.   After  completing their training successfully,  they   resumed   their   duty   as   flying  officers.  the thrust was on the critical tactics to fight  with   terrorists   in   mountainous   terrains.  There were combined Exercise of Mangolian  army   and   ‘Jammu   and   Kashmir   Rifles’.  The Exercise of Indian and American army  together was done in America. The Exercise  with   Sri   Lankan   army   was   organised   in  Pune. This practice session was meant for  training the soldiers for fighting terrorism  in   semi-urban   environment.   Exercise   with  Russian military was organised in Russia.  Similar   Exercise   were   organised   with  Bangladesh and England as well.  Such   Exercise   are   useful   for   both  countries   because   of   the   technological  exchange that happens on these occasions.  They   help   to   know   and   practice   new  methods of resolving problems. The process  of modernisation of arms gives impetus to  further research.  To join the armed forces is a one of  the   best   careers   for   young   people.   There  are about eight sections in the Indian army  where   women   officers   can   join   on   short

96  Anna Hazare  in India, which provide accommodation to  young people at minimum rates.  The training programmes are arranged  by this association through ‘Bharat Scouts  and   Guides’,   ‘National   Service   Scheme’  and ‘National Cadet Corps’.  11.8 Right to Information Act 2005  This kind of Act was first applied in  Sweden in 1776. In 1946, ‘United Nations’  declared the ‘Right to Information’, to be  the fundamental human right. In 1982, L.K.  Kulwal, a resident of Jaipur in Rajasthan,  a   social   activist,   initiated   the   process   by  applying   to   know   the   Jaipur   Municipal  Corporation’s work for cleaning the city. In  the case filed in this matter, the High Court,  gave a clear verdict stating that ‘Right to  Information’ is a fundamental right of all  citizens.   In   1990   Aruna   Roy   started   the  movement called as ‘Majdoor Kisan Shakti  Sanghatan’.   A   need   for   ‘Right   to  Information’   was   expressed   through   this  movement. The Divisional Commissioner of  Bilaspur   of   that   time,   Harsh   Mander,  showed   courage   to   disclose   official  information while serving as a bureaucrat.  The   information   he   disclosed   was   in   the  context   of   the   programme   of   distributing  food grains in lieu of  daily   wages.   The  struggle   of   Anna  Hazare   in   2001,   had  a   decisive   role   in  Maharashtra   in   this  matter.   The   Act   was  implemented   in  Maharashtra   since  12th October 2005.  The definition of the term ‘information’  includes   official   records,   documents,  memoranda,   e-mails,   comments,  consultations, press notes, circulars, orders,  logbooks,   tenders,   reports,   correspondence,  formats,   models,   electronic   data,   the  information   of   a   private   institution   or   an  individual that is available in the records  of any public establishment.  Right to information grants access to  official   documents,   records,   permission   to  obtain their copies, to take notes, to extract  passages,   to   get   samples   of   authorised  material and prints of data stored in CDs,  Floppy discs, Tapes, Video Cassettes or in  any other form, or stored on computers.  Citizens can get the desired information  after   submitting   an   application   to  ‘Information Officer’ of a Public Authority.  11.9 Reorganisation of States  The year 2000 proved to be important  for the formation of new states. States with  large areas (Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh  and   Bihar)   were   divided   and   new   states  were   formed.   New   states,   namely,  Chhattisgarh   (1st   November   2000),  Uttarakhand   (9th   November   2000)   and  Jharkhand   (15th   November   2000)   came  into   existence.   After   the   formations   of  lingual   states   in   India,   this   was   the   first  instance of formation of new states.  Chhattisgarh   :   The   demand   for   the  creation   of   separate   state   of   Chhattisgarh  was first put forth in the session of Indian  National   Congress   in   pre-independence  times.   However,   ‘States   Reorganisation  Commission headed by Fazal Ali, rejected  the demand. In 1998, in the session of the  Legislative   Assembly of Madhya Pradesh,  the proposal of creating a separate state of  Chhattisgarh   was   approved.   Later,   by   the  initiative of the Government of India, the  separate state of Chhattisgarh was created.  Uttarakhand :   The people of Garhwal  and Kumaon were demanding for a separate  state since 1930. It was supported in the  1938 session of Indian National Congress.  However, the Fazal Ali Commision ruled it  out.   The   people   in   this   region   started   a  movement   for   their   demand   in   1957.   In

97  1973   ‘Uttarakhand   Parvatiya   Rajya  Parishad’   was   established.   In   1994,   the  movement got intensified. In recognition of  the   popular   sentiment,   a   bill   for   separate  state   was   passed   by   the   Uttar   Pradesh  Legislative Assembly. Finally, in 2000 the  state   of   Uttaranchal   (later   named   as  Uttarakhand) came into being.  Jharkhand :   In 1929, the demand for  separate state of Jharkhand was staged for  the first time. In 1947, All India Jharkhand  Party was established and the demand for  a   separate   state   of   Jharkhand   was  accelerated.   In   1973,   an   appeal   was  presented   to   the   President   and   the   Prime  Minster.   In   1994,   the   Bihar   Legislative  Assembly   passed   the   bill   of   ‘Jharkhand  Area   Autonomous   Council   (JAAC)’.   In  August 2000, a bill providing for Bihar’s  division and creation of a separate state of  Jharkhand was passed in the lower house  of the Parliament (Lok Sabha). On the day  of 15th November 2000, the separate state  of Jharkhand came into existence.  Telangana   :   The   state   of   Telangana  was   formed   in   2014.   Earlier   it   was   an  integral part of the state of Andhra Pradesh.  ‘Telangana   Rashtriya   Samiti’   started   the  movement   for   the   creation   of   a   separate  state   of   Telangana.   In   2001,   Government  of   India   announced   the   decision   of   the  separate state of Telangana. In 2014, this  proposal was approved in the parliament.  On   2nd   June   2014,   the   separate   state   of  Telangana came into existence.  Jammu-Kashmir   and   Ladakh   :   The  state of Jammu-Kashmir and Ladakh was  given a special status by ‘Article 370’ of  the Constitution of India.  In 1947 Prem Nath Dogra established  ‘Jammu   Praja   Parishad’   party.   Its   initial  motto   was   ‘Ek   Vidhan,   Ek   Pradhan,   Ek  Nishan’.   Later, in 1952, it was changed  to ‘ Ek Desh me Do Vidhan, Do Pradhan,  Do Nishan Nahi Chalenge, Nahi Chalenge ’.  This party demanded complete accession of  Jammu and Kashmir to India. The party in  power, National Conference, however, was  not ready to give up the autonomy of the  state.   Dr.   Shyama   Prasad   Mukherjee  (Minister for Industry and Supply in Prime  Minister   Jawaharlal   Nehru’s   Cabinet)  supported the demand of complete merger.  Recently,   in   August   2019   Government   of  India   revoked   ‘Article   370’.   From   31st  October   2019   the   state   of   Jammu   and  Kashmir was restructured as two separate  Union Territories of ‘Jammu-Kashmir’ and  ‘Ladakh’.  In the next lesson we will study Social  domain, Sports as well as Tourism.  Q.1   Choose the correct alternative and rewrite  the statement.  1.

99  12.1   Social Domain  12.1.1 Health  12.1.2 Environment  12.1.3 Education  12.2 Sports  12.3 Cultural Heritage and Tourism  12.   India Transformed - Part II  12.1 Social Domain  India’s   transformation   is   reflected   in  the social domain also. The government is  actively trying to reduce the social disparity  and to bring all classes in the society in  the mainstream of economic development.  In this regard, the ‘Human Rights Protection  Act 1993’ is important.   ‘National Human  Rights Commission’ was established under  this   act.   Its   objective   is   to   protect  fundamental human rights, like the right to  life, equality, etc. and to see that nobody  is   deprived   of   these   rights.   According   to  this Act   the   Commission   can   act   on   the  basis of a report of a case of deprivation  of fundamental human rights, published in  newspaper   or   other   media   (‘Sui   Moto  Cognisance’). A complaint   can   be   lodged  by a social activist or a social institute on  behalf of the victim. In 2005 the ‘Domestic  Violence   Act’ was   passed.   This   Act   was  formed   to   provide   protection   to   women  from domestic violence. The most important  provision   in   this   Act   is   the   right   of   a  woman on the house where she has been  residing, even if she doesn’t own the house.  According to 2011 census the sex ratio  in India, is alarming. The ration of girls is  very low. In the age group of 0-1years the  number of girls is 914 against 1000 boys.  This   statistics   was   a   warning   of   a   grim  social   situation   and   several   women  organisations raised a voice expressing their  concern.   The   State   Government   of  Maharashtra   banned   sex/gender   prediction  tests of a fetus and launched a programme  called ‘Lek Ladaki’. Gradually the social  loathing for the birth of a girl is diminishing  because of the growing awareness.  12.1.1 Health  Polio eradication :   The transformation  of India was bound to reflect in the field  of ‘Health’.   In 1995 the health department  of   the   Indian   government   launched   the  campaign, dubbed as ‘Pulse Polio’. It was  started   jointly   under   the   sponsorship   of  ‘Do Boond Zindagi ke’  Do you know   ?  Hamid   Dalwai  was   inspired   by   the  work and thoughts of  Jotiba   Phule.   He  founded   ‘Muslim  Satyashodhak Samaj’  in   1970.   His   main  concern   was   the  rights   of   Muslim  women.   He   opposed   the   custom   of  ‘Triple Talaq’. The law passed by the  Indian Parliament in 2019, has declared  this custom as illegal.  He   was   of   the   opinion   that   in  secular India, uniform civil code should  be applicable to all.  Hamid Dalwai

100  ‘World   Health   Organisation   –   WHO’,  UNICEF,   Rotary   International   and  Government of India. This campaign was  for the eradication of polio. The campaign  was run with a determination not to leave  a single child under the age of five years  without   administering   polio   vaccination.  Various   means   were   used   to   make   the  campaign   absolutely   successful,   such   as  awareness camps, home visits and extensive  advertising through various media.  AYUSH   :   The ‘Ministry of Health and  Family   Welfare’   of   the   Government   of  India   opened   a   new   department   for  developing alternate medicine like Ayurveda,  Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Homeopathy,  etc. Since 2009, this department is known  as   ‘Department   of   Ayurveda,   Yoga   and  Naturopathy, Unani Medicine, Siddha and  Homeopathy’ (AYUSH). It is working for  the development of   syllabi and education  of   these   branches   of   medicine,   advanced  research, standardisation of medicine, etc.  Try to do this:  NRHM – Make a list of the benefits  of the National Rural Health Mission to  people.  12.1.2 Environment  Most of the states in India are facing  the problem of increasing air pollution. The  pollution caused by automobiles is an issue  of great worry. The ‘Centre for Science and  Environment’   studied   the   problem   of  pollution   in   Delhi   and   made   the   public  aware   of   it   severity.   It   has   been   proved  that   the   cause   of   pollution   in   Delhi   is  basically   the   increasing   number   of  automobile, vehicles with poor maintenance  running on the street that cause emission  containing   poisonous   gases   and   carbon  particles. The heritage monuments in Delhi  are   also   getting   affected   because   of   the  pollution. The institution recommended the  use of CNG – Compressed Natural Gas as  fuel for vehicles to overcome the pollution  problem.   Based   on   this   recommendation,  the Supreme Court issued an order of using  CNG for public transport vehicles, in 1998.  Later,   a   policy   of   permitting   only   those  vehicles   as   roadworthy,   which   passed   the  test   of   ‘Pollution   Under   control   –   PUC’  was adopted. It was decided that vehicles  without   ‘PUC’ certificate   will   not   qualify  for   insurance   and   renewal   of   insurance.  Several   centres   issuing   PUC   certificates  were   opened.   Chemical   effluents   drained  into rivers and streams is the major source  of water pollution.  Efforts   of   a   number   of   environment  activists   have   contributed   significantly   to  environment conservation and preservation.  Among them, Sundarlal Bahuguna (‘Chipko’  Movement),   Medha   Patkar   (‘Narmada  Bachao’   Movement)   and   Dr.   Rajendra  Singh   (Water   Conservation)   are   some  prominent names.  The   pollution   of   water   and   food   is  increasing   because   of   artificial   and   non-  biodegradable   materials   like   plastic   and  pesticides. This is also causing degradation  of   the   soil.   It   causes   a   spurt   of   various  diseases   in   humans,   animals   and   plants  that creates a   harmful situation for general  health.  Try to do this:  Make a list of solutions to reduce the  levels of air pollution.  Three   experiments   in   Maharashtra,   in  the context of conservation and preservation  of   environment   are   indeed   worthy   of  mention.  Rahibai Popere :   On 8th March 2018,  Rahibai   Popere   was   felicitated   by   the  President of India by ‘Nari Shakti Award’.  This award was given to her for her work  in ‘Kalasubai Parisar Biyanee Samvardhan

101  Samiti’. She is popularly  known   as   ‘Beejmata’  (Seed   Mother).   She   has  worked   for   preserving  seeds   of   native   cultivars  for the future generations.  Her   grandson   got   ill  because   of   the   diet  consisting   of   food   made  with   hybrid   varieties   of   food-grains   and  vegetables of lesser quality. She thought of  native varieties of food-grains to overcome  the problem. She decided to grow the food-  grains and vegetables of native variety to  meet her family’s needs. She began to do  it   and   store   the   seeds   of   those   landraces  (Deshi Van). Bitter gourd (karle), Spinach  (palak), Amaranthus Tricolour (tandulja/lal  math), Sweet beans (hyacinth beans/pavata),  Bitter   beans   /   twisted   beans   (kadu   wal),  Ghevada   (kidney   beans),   Groundnut  (bhuimoog),   Barnyard   millet   (varai),  varieties   of   rice   -   Dhavul   Bhat,   Kalbhat.  Ambemohor, Black Gram (udid), etc. She  did   not   confine   her   efforts   only   to   her  family; but, through micro banking groups  ( bachat gat ) she spread it to the surrounding  villages. The movement started by her grew  well   with   the   partnership   of   ‘Bharatiya  Agro Industries Foundation (BAIF)’.  Rahibai preserves the seeds in earthen  pots.   Once   filled   she   closes   the   pot   by  plastering its mouth by a mixture of soil  and cow dung. This method saves the seeds  from insects and ants. Before closing the  pot the seeds are covered with a layer of  ash   and   neem   leaves.   Now   in   her   seed  bank she has a collection of more than 50  landraces of food-grains and 30 landraces  of vegetables. She is one of the three Indian  women   selected   as   ‘Women   of   the   Year  2018’ by   BBC, among 100 women from  various countries.  Bhau Katdare :   Bhau Katdare and his  associates   work   for   the  conservation   of   nature  through   an   institute,  called   ‘Sahyadri   Nisarg  Mitra’.   In   1999,   Bhau  Katdare   read   about   the  ‘White-breasted   Sea  Eagle’ as an endangered  species.   He   began   his  work   in   Ratnagiri   district,   to   save   and  conserve   this   bird.   He   created   public  awareness about this bird, by trekking the  sea coast of the district. In this he found  out   62   nesting   sites   of   the   bird.   While  doing this, he and his associates detected  some instances of smuggling of the nests  of birds known as ‘Indian Swiftlets’ (Pakoli)  at   Bandra   island,   which   is   located   near  Vengurla   Rocks,   in   the   vicinity   of   the  Nivati port in Sindhudurg district. The nests  were   smuggled   out   and   sold   in   foreign  countries. There was a need to save these  birds   and   their   nests.   ‘Sahyadri   Nisarg  Mitra’ worked in that direction. As a result  Indian Swiftlets were included in Schedule  ‘I’ (a list of wildlife, offence against which  is   punishable)   of   the   ‘Wildlife   Protection  Act 1972’. This is a remarkable contribution  of ‘Sahyadri Nisarga Mitra’.  ‘Sahyadri   Nisarg   Mitra’   also   worked  for the protection of Olive Ridley turtles.  The females of this species come to Velas  beach (Ratnagiri district) for nesting. Bhau  Katdare   and   his   associates   planned   an  operation for the protection of these nests.  In   the   first   year,   they   were   successful   in  protecting 50 nests. 2734 baby turtles from  those 50 nests, were successfully released  back into the sea. This proved to be a start  of   an   annual   event,   ‘Turtle   Festival’.  Hundreds   of   tourists   come   every   year   to  watch the occasion of baby turtles returning  to sea. To accommodate them facilities for  ‘Home Stay’ were developed. The peasants  were trained for the management of ‘Home  Bhau Katdare  Rahibai Popere

102  Stay’.   Thus,   efforts   for   conservation   of  nature resulted into development of tourism  as well. The news of this development was  well   appreciated   in   Maharashtra.   Now,  Bhau   Katdare   and   his   associates   are  working for the protection of the endangered  ‘Pangolin’ (ant eater/Khavalya Manjar).  Premsagar   Mestri   :   The   number   of  vultures   is   rapidly   decreasing   in   India.  Vultures are the scavengers in the nature.  Two   species   of   vultures,   ‘Long   billed  Vultures’   and   ‘White   back   Vultures’,   are  observed   in   the   region   around   Raigad.  Premsagar   Mestri   and   his   associates   are  working for increasing their numbers and to  make available safe food for them through  ‘Society   for   Eco   Endangered   Species  Conservation and Protection-SEESCAP’, a  non-governmental   organisation.   Painkillers  (a drug called diclophenac) given to animals  has proved to be toxic for vultures. Besides,  dearth of trees with adequate height, scarcity  of food, have also caused the decrease in  vulture   population.   People   working   for  SEESCAP are gradually getting success in  changing these circumstances.  12.1.3 Education  1990 was declared as the ‘International  Year   of   Literacy’.   The   state   Government  resolved to make Kerala a state with 100%  literacy, in the international year of literacy.  Accordingly, Kerala became the first state  in   India   to   become   a   state   with   100%  literacy.  Try to do this.  1990 was the ‘International Year  of Literacy’. Make a list of similarly  declared international years for special  causes and campaigns launched on the  occasion.  The   campaign   of   literacy   in   Kerala  included   training   of   reading,   writing,  mathematical skills, importance of hygiene  and cleanliness, vaccination of children, co-  operative   agriculture   and   importance   of  saving   money.   During   the   campaign   for  literacy,   some   additional   problems   were  observed.   Many   senior   citizens   who  participated in the campaign had eyesight  related   problems,   which   were   unattended  before.   Many   of   the   unskilled   labourers  could not afford the medical eye examination  and   cost   of   spectacles.   In   order   to   help  them,   free   medical   camps   for   eye  examination and distribution of spectacles  were   arranged.   Then   people   could   easily  attend   the   literacy   classes.   This   is   an  example of a problem solved with combined  will power of the government and people.  Do you know   ?  The   Government   of   Maharashtra  decided to teach English from the 1st  standard   so   that   the   children   could  master   English   language   along   with  their   mother   tongue.   Emphasis   was  laid   on   listening,   speaking,   reading,  and writing skills with the emphasis on  children   enjoying   the   learning   of  English   language.   Following   the  syllabus,   the   Maharashtra   State  Textbook Bureau (Balbharati) took up  the   responsibility   of   preparing   best,  illustrated textbooks. The initiative was  appreciated by the National Knowledge  Commission.  The first district in Kerala to become  completely   literate   was   Ernakulum.  Announcement to this effect was made on  4th February 1990.

103  Education – with special reference  to Maharashtra  The transformation of India is true  in   the   field   of   education   as   well.   The  ‘National   Council   of   Educational  Research and Training’, Delhi suggested  some modifications in the school syllabi  and   the   structure   of   school   text   books.  The guidelines in the new syllabi were  based   on   democratic   principles,   social  justice,   awareness   of   duties   and  responsibilities, gender equality, protection  of   environment,   eradication   of  superstitions,   population,   education   as  also   individual   behavior.   The   syllabi  were also oriented toward increasing the  awareness of national unity in diversity.  Training   programmes   for   teachers   are  arranged   all   over   Maharashtra   for  intensifying   the   efforts   to   fulfill   the  objectives of the new syllabi. It helped  to   bring   awareness   regarding   the   state  level   training   and   school   text   books,  comparable to the awareness created at  the time of   ‘National Literacy Mission’.  In 1990 the report of ‘Acharya Ram  Murti   Committee’ was   received   by   the  Government   of   India.   The   committee  examined the National Educational Policy  (NEP).   The   committee   in   its   report  emphasised   on   universalisation   of  education,   education   for   women   and  backward   classes   and   educational  democracy The committee recommended  to   include   education   in   fundamental  rights and to raise the government funds  allotted to education.  Beside it, the matter of the weight  of a schoolbag that a child has to carry,  was   also   carefully   considered   and  directives   in   this   aspect   were   laid   out.  The   practice   of   interviewing   children  before school admission was banned. In  the   new   millennium,   the   Government  under ‘Sarva   Shiksha Abhiyan’ set the  following   objectives.   To   enrole   every  children in school to raise the standard  of   education;   to   eliminate   the   gender  discrimination   in   education,   to   achieve  100 % attendance in schools by 2010.  Central Schools, with uniform syllabi  were   created   throughout   the   country   so  that the wards of Central Government’s  and Armed   Forces   employees   may   not  have to suffer from obstructions in their  education because of the frequent transfers  of   their   parents.   The   Central   Schools  focus   on   sports   and   extra-curricular  activities along with the academic syllabi.  The   programmes   like   ‘Ratrashala’  (Night   Schools),   ‘Sakharshala’ (Schools  for   the   seasonal   workers   harvesting  sugarcane)   deserve   a   special   mention  here. The first night school in Maharastra  was started by Mahatma Jotirao Phule in  the   19th   century.   A   number   of   night  schools are run in Maharashtra, inspired  by   Mahatma   Phule’s   work.   This  programme is specially meant to benefit  the students who work in daytime. In the  season   of   sugarcane   harvesting,   many  labourers migrate temporarily to the sites  of   various   sugar   factories. To   facilitate  the   education   of   their   children   special  schools,   known   as   ‘Sakharshala’   were  started in the vicinity of sugar factories.  The   State   administration   is   taking   help  of   voluntary   organisations   to   increase  literacy rate. This has helped in achieving  100%   literacy   in   the   districts   of  Sindhudurg   and   Wardha.   It   provided  an   impetus   to   adult   education.   The  government   provided   books   to   school  children for supplementary reading.

104  Primary Education  In   1994,   District   Primary   Education  Programme (DPEP) was started aiming at  providing   access   to   primary   education   to  all.   This   programme   was   implemented   in  seven   states   of   Maharashtra,   Madhya  Pradesh,   Karnataka,   Tamil   Nadu,   Kerala,  Haryana and Assam. This programme was  aimed   at   achieving   hundred   percent  registration and attendance of children   in  primary   schools   and   bringing   down   the  number of drop-outs. This programme was  financially supported by the World Bank.  Mid Day Meal (Shaley Poshan Ahar)   :  This   programme   was   implemented   from  15th   August   1995,   to   provide   mid   day  meals   to   children   in   primary   schools.  Wherever,   facilities   to   cook   the   food   in  school was not available, food-grains were  distributed to each child.  Sarva   Shiksha   Abhiyan   –   SSA   :  “Let’s   all   learn,   Let’s   all   progress”   (‘सारे  श श कू  ्य   ा, पुढे जाऊ  ्य   ा’)   was the motto of this  programme. With this motto, the programme  was   launched   in   2001.   The   right   of   free  education   was   granted   to   children   in   the  age group of 6-14 vide the ‘86 th   Amendment  to   the   Constitution   of   India’.   The   main  objective of ‘Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan’ was  to eliminate the disproportion in the access  to   primary   education.   Earlier   programmes  like   ‘Khadu-Phala   Yojana’,   ‘Mid   Day  Meal’ were combined with this programme  to   make   it   successful.   This   programme  gave special attention to the education of  girls   and   children   with   special   needs  ( Diyang ).  To achieve universalisation of education  in India, ‘EDUSAT’ (GSAT-3)’, a satellite  was launched in 2004. For the purpose of  reaching out to children all over the country  six   communication   zones   and   accordingly  six channels were created.   This programme  facilitated   distance   education   in   regional  language in all parts of the country.  12.2 Sports  There   were   times,   when   the   Indian  hockey   team   used   to   returned   home  victorious   from   international   matches;  Indian   wrestlers   like  Khashaba   Jadhav   earned  fame   in   international  wrestling.   In   the   course  of globalisation some new  sports   became   popular  and   many   sportspersons  emerged   from   various  parts of the country. With  globalisation,   one   thing   had   become   very  clear that sportspersons with extraordinary  skills will only rise in their career. Present  scenario   of   the   sports   world   has   an  unmistakable   message   that   yesteryears   of  success do not guarantee a success today  or tomorrow. In other words, a champion  in the past may lose his position any time,  if he does not keep up the hard work. It  is essential for sportspersons in all fields to  prove themselves every time they play.  New   records   have   been   made   every  day to break the old ones. The formats and  the rules   of the games are being modified  time   and   again.   Let’s   elaborate   this   with  the example of the game of cricket. In the  olden days, a cricket match used to run for  five   days.   Then   one-day   matches   were  introduced   and   then   the   cricket   matches  were   limited   only   to   20   overs.   Earlier,   a  wrestling match was not concluded till one  of the wrestlers was pinned down ( chitpat  karane )   completely.   However,   now   a  wrestling match gets concluded on the basis  of points scored by the wrestlers.  Today, there are many types of sports,  such   as,   Kabaddi,   Hockey,   Cricket,  Swimming,   Badminton,   Weightlifting,  Shooting, Chess, Motor sports, Sky Diving,  Boxing,   Archery,   Wrestling,   Football  Khashaba Jadhav

105  (Soccer), Tennis, Table Tennis (Ping-pong),  Billiards and Snooker, Mallakhamb, Body  building,   and   so   on.   Media   and   news  channels have special slots for these games.  There are a number of sports journals  published in India. Some television channels  are devoted to sports. The audience of sport  channels,   advertisements   shown   on   these  channels, time slots and expenses of these  advertisements are vital factors, which have  shaped an independent sphere of marketing.  There are independent clubs/associations  of   each   sport   established   in   India.   These  associations are investing on large scale in  sportspersons on individual merit. A football  player may be adopted professionally by a  football   club.   Then   the   club   would   take  care   of   the   player   including   his   training.  He/she has to sign a professional contract  with   the   club.   The   player’s   name   gets  associated with the club. The IPL matches  of cricket, the World Cup matches of one  day cricket and 20-20 cricket or the matches  organisd   by   the   Pro   Kabaddi   League   in  India,   presently   known   as   ‘Vivo   Kabaddi  League’   are   the   examples   of  professionlisation of the sports world. The  professionally played matches have gained  worldwide   audience.   That   has   resulted   in  the   increase   of   the   honourarium   of   the  players.  The government is also taking a note  of   sportspersons   for   their   performance.  Sportspersons,   who  perform   extraordinarily  well   are   honoured   with  various   awards.   Sachin  Tendulkar   was   awarded  with   the   highest   award  of ‘Bharat Ratna’ by the  government.   He   was  nominated   as   ‘Member  of Rajyasabha’ ( Khasdar ).  The   sportspersons   are  receiving more popular support and respect.  Sports   are   more   and   more   perceived   as  prospective   professional   careers   for   the  youth.   Sport   has   become   an   inseparable  part of school and college education.  National   Sports   policy   :   The  participation of sportspersons in international  sports tournaments, increasing use of science  and   modern   technology   in   the   field   of  sports   is   reflected   in   the   sports   policy   of  every   nation.   Government   of   India  announced   its   sports   policy   in   2001. The  main   objectives   of   this   policy   include,   to  take   sports   to   all   parts   of   India,   to   help  the   players   to   develop   special   skills,   to  build   supportive   and   fundamental   sports  facilities, to help National Sports Federation  of   India   and   associated   institutions   and  search   for   sports   talent,   to   initiate   co-  operation   from   industries,   corporate   and  private institutions for the cause of sports,  to create awareness of the importance of  sports and interest in sports, among people.  In 2011 Government of India announced  a   scheme   named   as   ‘Come   and   Play’.  Through this scheme five sports complexes  in Delhi under ‘Sports Authority of India  (SAI)’ were made available to local youth.  They were also provided with an opportunity  to train under SAI coaches. The next step  of the efforts of developing sports was the  founding of National Sports University, at  Manipur   in   2018.   The   courses   include  Bachelor and Master’s, M. Phil and Ph.D.  courses   in   sports   education,   sports  management,   sports   psychology,   coaching  etc. Research in sports is also encouraged.  Khelo India :   The Indian government  launched   a   new   scheme   named,   ‘Khelo  India’ by combining some old schemes and  some   new   objectives.   The   scheme   was  launched with the objective of creating a  larger   popular   platform   and   to   establish  excellence   in   sports.   The   scheme   has   12  basic   aspects.   Two   major   aspects   among  Sachin Tendulkar

106  them   are   to   create   interest   about   sports  among students from early days in school  and to increase girls’ participation in sports.  The   ‘National   Sports   Development  Fund’ was established for the development  of sports. A donation to this fund is eligible  for 100% exemption from income tax. The  ‘Rajiv   Gandhi   Khelratna’   award   was  announced with an intention of encouraging  players. (This award consists of Rs.7,50,000,  for   excellent   performance   in   the   previous  year of announcement of the award. It was  given to the captain of Indian cricket team,  Virat   Kohli   and   Saikhom   Mirabai   Chanu  for weightlifting in 2018.) Apart from this,  there are other awards like ‘Arjun Award’,  ‘Dhyanchand Lifetime Achievement Award’,  ‘Dronacharya   Award’,   ‘Maulana   Abul  Kalam Azad Trophy’ and ‘National Sports  Encouragement Award’.   The sportspersons,  who win gold medal in Olympic games are  awarded Rs.75,00,000 each. The teams and  sportsperson,   who   win   gold,   silver   and  bronze medals in various competitions such  as   Para   Olympic,   Asiad,   Commonwealth,  World   Cup,   Asian   Championship,  International   University   Tournaments,  International tournaments for the disabled,  Cricket tournaments for visually impaired,  etc., are given good amount of rewards and  jobs.  Besides, there is provision of pension  for the retired sportspersons. Since 2018, a  winner of the Olympics is granted a pension  of Rs.20,000 per month and a winner of  the Asian games is granted Rs.12,000 per  month.  Thus,   the   Government   of   India   is  opening   many   avenues   for   making   the  youth   aware   of   sports   as   life   career.  Students can avail of many opportunities in  this field.  12.3 Cultural Heritage and Tourism  Find out and tell us.  •   Make   a   list   of   employment  opportunities   generated   by   the  tourism industry.  •   Suggest   ways   and   means   to  enhance heritage and historical  tourism in India.  Tourism   industry   is   a   continuously  developing   field.   This   industry   earns   the  country foreign exchange on a large scale.  The number of tourists visiting India and  the   revenue   earned   through   them   is  increasing every year. Government is trying  to   create   various   facilities   for   the  convenience of tourists visiting India from  other   countries.   The   three   ministries   of  Home Affairs, Tourism and Foreign Affairs  together   created   the   facility   of   e-visa   for  them,   which   included   e-business   visa,  e-medical visa and e-visa. A service giving  information   on   mobile   to   the   tourists   not  only in Hindi and English but also in ten  other   foreign   languages   for   24   hours  throughout   the   week   was   started.   These  languages include Arabic, French, German,  Italian, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Russian  and   Spanish.   This   information   is   made  available by the Ministry of Tourism. For  this facility the tourists have to dial 1363.  The information covers various topics like  cruise   tours,   adventurous   sports   tourism,  health tourism, facilities for sports like golf  and polo, eco-friendly tourism, film festivals  and so on.  Institutes for systematic training of soft  skills, such as proper manners of receiving  and   helping   tourists,   communicating   with  them   have   been   opened.   Hotels   with  amenities and accommodation of premium  quality are available to tourists. Institutes

To boost tourism to  places of unique nature and culture in the  northeastern states of India, the travel show  entitled   ‘GONORTHEAST’   was   released  on   the   Discovery   channel.   Through   the  ‘Swadesh Darshan’ programme 13 types of  pilgrimage   tours   have   been   launched.   It  includes tours to Himalayas, coastal regions,  Buddhist centres, etc.  The   information   of   several   uniquely  featured   tourist   places   in   India,   is   being  publicised   through   electronic   and   digital  media.   Channels   like   ‘BBC’,   ‘Discovery’,  ‘History’   are   running   programmes  introducing   India’s   historical   and   cultural  heritage   to   the   world.
